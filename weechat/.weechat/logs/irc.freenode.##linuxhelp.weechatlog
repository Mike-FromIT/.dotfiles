When overwriting is enabled, BleachBit wipes the data with a single pass of blank data. At the end of a file, it may write additional data to wipe the slack space. To hide the original name, BleachBit renames the file to a long name and then a short name. Finally, the file is deleted.

2018-08-16 18:24:53	konrados	Hi again! It seems that if in my test.sh file I want to redirect the 'stdoutput' to a file script-wise, i.e. for the whole script, not just one command in it, I need to do `exec 1>some_file`;right? But how... does it work, how is it related to what man says about exec: "The  exec()  family  of  functions replaces the current process image with a new process image" - what's the connection here?
2018-08-16 18:25:21	konrados	Am I even reading the right Man? It's EXEC(3)

2018-08-16 18:28:44	koala_man	I mean, 'exec foo > file' would also do that, but it would end up execve'ing after. In this case, the actual exec is skipped so the redirections apply to the current executable
2018-08-16 18:29:12	konrados	koala_man: ahh, so it's kind of a trick?
2018-08-16 18:29:16	ayecee	konrados: if it's part of a script, you'd be referring to the exec section of the shell's manpage, e.g. man bash
2018-08-16 18:30:00	ayecee	i think it's in the built in commands section
2018-08-16 18:30:03	koala_man	konrados: kind of, yes. 'exec > file' does everything *except* execve. sounds weird, but makes a lot of sense in syscall terms
2018-08-16 18:30:29	konrados	ayecee: will see, thanks!
2018-08-16 18:30:30	koala_man	and yes, use 'help exec' or 'man bash' to see the documentation for the 'exec' builtin

But we want to retain the rights the official repository, and make a clear distinction between what has been merged from the community and into our brand what is not.

I can get the window to show, but it doesn't hsow the part to where I am able to actually type in my details.

I do however get a few errors.  libjawt.so is not found, and I get a invalid color conversion error.  I have installed the latest openjdk11 and openjdk10, and so far nothing has worked.  I installed the jdk variants of those which should include the libjawt.so, but it seems that maybe the path to the libraries is

2018-08-18 01:37:50	hexnewbie	As to what is problematic: Everything. 1) I try to copy 10 ISOs to a server, and Plasma suddenly uses 100% CPU to display a progress bar in the task bar *for the entire hour the ISOs get copied*. 2) I try to search for a file in Dolphin, if I accidentally write too short a search string, Dolphin crashes and doesn't work until a reboot, and causes Plasma to act odd too. 3) Can't switch windows - the *only* Alt+Tab theme is so big I don't see
2018-08-18 01:37:50	hexnewbie	anything (literally, I don't know what I'm switching to), and clicking on the task bar button to switch instead causes drag & drop of the *desktop* file of the program

2018-08-18 02:55:44	sentiment	hello. I am considering to switch from software development to sysadmin/DevOps kind of job. Reading about it on websites, it seems that most argue against that switch, instead vote for the other way around. The oft-mentioned reason is the higher salary of software development and the lesser stress associated with it as compared to sysadmin (DevOps?).

2018-08-18 05:06:29	bogdaniel	guys i'm having a bit of an issue here usign nodejs on arch linux. i installed yarn package manager and from there i installed the vue-cli package but after i tried running vue --version it hit me with command not found .
2018-08-18 05:06:31	kristina	and saner solutions never make it into mainline. still no sane ipc in mainline. everything is rejected.
2018-08-18 05:07:08	bogdaniel	if i go in this folder ~/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/@vue/cli/bin and i run from there node vue it works just fine. any advice on how to tackle it ?
2018-08-18 05:07:32	kristina	aynthing sane is rejected, not just concurrency or ipc, i mean, codesigning was rejected, fat elf file support rejected.

2018-08-18 05:36:58	hexnewbie	blip99: It's likely in state D, waiting for an I/O to complete. If your network lagged/hung (e.g. the server crashed or you pulled the cable) it won't come back until it comes back. Although nfs and cifs should support interrupting I/O by kill -9...

2018-08-18 05:53:19	hexnewbie	blip99: Nothing to do with powerfulness. All kind of filesystem I/O causes processes to wait until completion (uninterruptable sleep, state D). If your hard drive starts dying, processes will wait for I/Os to complete before dying even if you kill them. THen, in turn, you can't unmount because the blocked process is using the filesystem. NFS implements a workaround, CIFS doesn't apparently

2018-08-18 09:02:47	fromBeyond	Hi, this perhaps may not be the place, but it is the main channel i use, so i will try. I have setup the start ip address of my linksys router to be 192.168.1.100. Yet the ip it gives my machine is 192.168.1.6. Any ideas why it might be ignoring my settings?

2018-08-18 12:05:41	naftilos76	Hi i am using update-rc.d to set a bash script to execute on startup and shutdown. There seems to be a problem as the priority is important. I do "sudo update-rc.d defaults 99 1" to force the script to execute after last in line and be stoped first. While K is confirmed to be K01 after doing "ls /etc/rc* -l" , S is strangely persistent at S02 and i do not know why. The result is that the script (which runs a couple of ruby scripts) does not do what
2018-08-18 12:05:41	naftilos76	it is supposed to. Is 99 too large? Can anybody help?

Now I'm to the second part here: http://linux-exynos.org/wiki/ARM_Chromebook/U-Boot_Environment#Importing_an_environment and I don't understand how to access the /boot/env.txt file it references. Should this be on partition 1 with the uboot stuff?

2018-08-18 13:26:17	jim	cool... so, now, here's the difference between using a disk partition for a filesystem directly, and using a disk partition for LVM: with LVM, instead of putting filesystems in partitions directly, you put 'LVM physical volumes' in partitions, then you make a 'volume group' (which is just a list of physical volumes), and put physical volumes in the volume groups, then you can make 'logical volumes', and these are allocated out of the volume groups

2018-08-18 13:33:12	jim	natesreich, once you're using lvm for the "partition" used for the db (probably / or /var if it's separate), you can allocate more space to it later from the volume group... AND, you can ask the vps provider to give you more storage, which you can put another LVM physical volume (pv for short) on that storage, add it to the volume group (vg for short) and now you have more storage you can use to enlarge your LVs

2018-08-18 21:09:26	fromBeyond	Hi, when I plug in my usb headset, one of the two happens: for ome programs, the playback is through the headphones, and for others the playback is still through the speakers. In the latter case, I open pavucontrol and manually change it to headphones and it works. How can I automate this, so that it works in all cases

2018-08-18 21:58:36	Psi-Jack	Before, it wasn't "flawless" albeit it "worked". I used to use Solus, and had my own ~/.config/pulse/default.pa, and after every update somehow it broke every time. I got tired of it.

2018-08-18 22:00:34	fromBeyond	Psi-Jack: I have another thing I want to configure. All outputs have their own sound levels. This means that when jack headset is plugged in, it was at lets say 30%. Speakers are at 50%, usb headset is at 70%. What I want is that when the source is changed, I can triger an event. I have it written so that when the jack is pluged in, my sound level in the statusbar gets refreshed. I want to set up something
2018-08-18 22:00:35	fromBeyond	similar for the usb headset.
2018-08-18 22:00:57	Psi-Jack	Hmmmm
2018-08-18 22:01:26	Psi-Jack	That might be a little more difficult, depending on what you're using to show that. I'm assuming something with i3bar, or i3status.
2018-08-18 22:01:48	Psi-Jack	And if so, you're basically going to likely have to make something yourself.

2018-08-18 23:30:58	pnbeast	gbellinoz, procmail your cron job noise off someplace distinct, then use a script to sort through them.
2018-08-18 23:31:37	darkmeson	gbellinoz: specifically "passive checks". that allows for the systems to report back on their own, but can also complain if they fail to check in (or fail to check in X times on interval Y, or whatever)

My friend describes her ubuntu 16.04 this way: "The videos are choppy, scrolling the page is choppy, text takes a few moments to appear on the screen, but my mouse is perfectly fine and not choppy/laggy." Her video feed to me is not choppy, either, so it is not like the entire system is screwed.

2018-08-19 11:09:30	jim	redruM, with LVM, instead of putting filesystems in partitions directly, you put 'LVM physical volumes' in partitions, then you make a 'volume group' (which is just a list of physical volumes), and put physical volumes in the volume groups, then you can make 'logical volumes', and these are allocated out of the volume groups
