I guess I could get rid of the automounts, since it looks like PCManFM is trying to get information from /efi and /boot, which causes the automounts to fail. But I'm not sure why it doesn't just fail silently when the backing device isn't present

2019-05-01 19:29:25	jollydutchman	jamespharvey20: That's not really a solution, though. Again, automounts are set up, so it'll just get re-mounted whenever a program (e.g. file manager) requests information about those directories. That's fine, since I want that to happen, but normal use of the system is that after boot, the drive *itself* is removed for convenience until a reboot or sysupgrade is needed

2019-05-01 21:36:58	pronoun	do you maybe have some other network manager running? maybe you need to enable the iwd service to get it to startup on boot?

2019-05-19 18:28:57	atlas_	ngl, I have no idea. Don't tell anyone but I'm using manjaro on only this one machine because I can't get graphics drivers to work on it for some reason, and I've worked with Arch for a while.

2019-05-19 21:50:15	jamespharvey20	can you find the refind application in your efi partition?

2019-05-19 21:51:07	Tacklebox	the refind.conf mentioned on that page exists on my system but is not the one in use as it is identical to the refind.conf sample file with many boot options that don't appear, and incorrect UUIDs which don't exist

2019-05-19 22:00:07	jamespharvey20	none of the firewalls on the wiki, including nftables, are arch-specific.  i don't know which would be available on centos and ubuntu, but i'd imagine most/all of them would be.  could be slight variations in syntax if those distros have other versions, especially centos.
2019-05-19 22:01:03	jamespharvey20	Tacklebox: ok, it does look like your efi is probably mounted.  can you post "mount" and "sudo find /efi -ls"

2019-05-19 22:11:45	Tacklebox	is microcode important enough to risk it?
2019-05-19 22:11:55	Tacklebox	cause thats what im trying to add

2019-05-19 22:12:16	jamespharvey20	and be able to edit your boot config in general

2019-05-19 22:17:51	jamespharvey20	wiki includes this: "By default, rEFInd will scan all of your drives (that it has drivers for) and add a boot entry for each EFI bootloader it finds, which should include your kernel (since Arch enables EFISTUB by default). So you may have a bootable system at this point."

2019-05-19 22:18:36	jamespharvey20	not sure if it's talking about it doing that at runtime or not.  if it is, then it might see there's no valid menuentries and on each boot basically be creating one for you.  so, maybe it's as simple as commenting out the example menuentries and making your own.
2019-05-19 22:19:44	Tacklebox	I guess I can give that a shot, I may or may not report back if I bust this up. ty for the help if i kill it

2019-05-19 22:20:38	jamespharvey20	all the default menuentries have "disabled" so they don't need to be commented out i guess.  yeah, it must be looking at the drives and auto-generating what it needs to boot it.  so i think you just have to add your own entry.

2019-05-20 02:18:42	SoleSoul	Hi. I created a PKGBUILD for an application. The package seems fine, but when I try to install it, it says that there are file conflicts: /usr/lib64 exists in filesystem (owned by filesystem) and /usr/lib64 exists in filesystem (owned by filesystem). Why does it complain on these two?

2019-05-20 02:24:32	sheep	which is why you need to make it possible for the builder to override

Solution was to go into BIOS (UEFI) and manually override it to boot from my efibootmgr set options. this refreshes wherever it stores args internally and fixes the issue.

2019-05-20 17:25:29	xelra	I have some weird issues with my mouse wheel that I've been trying to solve. The issue is that the mouse wheel doesn't work, while the pointer is moving. Here comes the weird part though. It always works in urxvt. Using libinput that's all I get. It doesn't work in GTK and also in Qt. Now if I switch the mouse to evdev, it suddenly works in GTK, but Qt is still a no. I just don't know where to start with this. Have been aimlessly trying to fix this 
2019-05-20 17:25:29	xelra	left and right for the past days.

2019-05-20 21:05:44	SysGhost	Most of the times included antennas are crappy. Just enough for very local area reception. Which is why one often get's third party antennas,m and for stationary usage, with an extended table-stand. Asus there might have included one, but there are third part variants. So don't loook so much at the antennas of a card, but rather the chipset it uses, and what standards is supports.

2019-05-20 21:12:34	Luxray5474	ok
2019-05-20 21:12:35	SysGhost	for UEFI boot, only one ESP partition per drive can be used (although several can be created). The usual practice is to let all OS's to share the same ESP partition. However, one can have one ESP partition per drive. Personally I do it that way when I set up dual booting on separate drives. Although... Windows tend to invade all ESP's it can find.
2019-05-20 21:13:50	Luxray5474	so, that means I install refind on windows efi partition, right?

2019-05-20 22:07:47	b1tninja	for instance if you upgrade your kernel
2019-05-20 22:07:50	b1tninja	and it deletes your old kernel modules
2019-05-20 22:08:05	b1tninja	and you boot the old kernel becuase you didn't replace the one in your non-standard-location-esp

2019-07-06 18:18:24	mingdao	limona: That is where you started determining what type of layout you wanted. Then you partitioned, then you formatted, then you should have mounted the partitions you created and formatted.
2019-07-06 18:18:36	BazookaTooth	earnestly: my esp mounts as /boot/efi/EFI and works fine. why are you saying that doesn't make sense?

2019-07-06 18:19:07	limona	if i mount /dev/sdb2
2019-07-06 18:19:11	thrice	limona: the quick summary, is that "EFI System Partition" (ESP for short) needs to be used.  You created that partition well, but didn't mount it.  So, grub now needs it, and you need to mount it for it to use
2019-07-06 18:19:17	henninb	Lartza Now when I start neovim I get the error File "/usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/powerline/bindings/vim/__init__.py", line 25, in get_vim_encoding  return vim.options['encoding'].decode('ascii') or 'ascii'

Do not try to guess your best mirrors. The ?rare and special circumstances? are things like your state censorship, ISP plan that taxes you for accessng some servers, having a mirror in your LAN or company network etc. Otherwise

2019-07-07 17:10:53	binTrl	earnestly: OK. It's not really Arch specific but there's a OS called Phoenix. It comes with crappy grub2 bootloader (and a windows installer). I just wish to boot it via systemd. It uses grub2's `root=(hdX,gptY)` to set the root beforehand and uses root=/dev/ram0 for the kernel param. This way it gets the correct real root on startup but in systemd boot I cannot change the ESP on the fly so I need to
2019-07-07 17:10:54	binTrl	specify real root somehow
2019-07-07 17:11:11	earnestly	binTrl: That root is not related to the kernel

2019-07-07 17:12:43	Lehthanis	if I already have a /home/username folder with stuff in it but no user by that name...does creating that username wipe that folder or will it leave the stuf fin tact?
2019-07-07 17:12:43	binTrl	earnestly: Yes I get it. But I am really confused as to how to tell the kernel where the real root is. It uses the same partition for ESP and everything so it gets away with it. But in systemd boot I need to have a different ESP and root.

2019-07-07 17:14:03	binTrl	I think kernel's root param should do the job but after reading the official kernel docs I got more confused as it says /dev/ram0 is the new way. So with /dev/ram0 where am I supposed to pass the real root ?

2019-07-07 19:42:19	Arbour	Hello, as I understand it, pacman's packages are downloaded directly from source. So when an app is updated, say on github, should it be updated on my machine when I run `pacman -Syu`?
2019-07-07 19:42:27	Arbour	in my case, it does not
2019-07-07 19:43:02	ajak_	because you misunderstand it
2019-07-07 19:43:37	BazookaTooth	Arbour: are you talking about AUR?
2019-07-07 19:44:06	ajak_	pacman doesn't use the AUR; they are referring to pacman

2019-07-07 19:44:49	rcf	Arbour: no, they're binary packages hosted on Arch mirrors. Usually built from latest stable *release* versions upstream.
2019-07-07 19:45:19	Arbour	I see. In that case do the maintainer of the package has to manually update it each time there is an update?
2019-07-07 19:45:26	rcf	Pretty much.
2019-07-07 19:45:26	mpan	Arbour: yes
2019-07-07 19:46:32	Arbour	Ok, thank you!
2019-07-07 19:46:35	rcf	If you want the super-awesome-latest-git versions, those are in the AUR, usually as packagename-git. You'll have to build them yourself, of course.
2019-07-07 19:47:11	mpan	(just be sure to read Arch Wiki first to understand what AUR is and what it is not)
2019-07-07 19:47:41	Arbour	Oh, I see, I have seen the same packages in both pacman and the AUR and was wondering why there was duplicates. That must be it.

Then tell it to apply that profile to the default display: colormgr device-add-profile /org/freedesktop/ColorManager/devices/xrandr_default <org-freedesktop-path-given-by-the-previous-command>

2019-07-08 20:00:29	ShapeShifter499	SysGhost, well for example, teal doesn't show up normally with the color icc file enabled with colormgr but if I take the same icc and enable it on purpose in something like gimp THEN it looks fine
2019-07-08 20:00:37	SysGhost	in "per application usage" it's more local depending on the application. GIMP for instance will only apply it to the canvas/drawing area and not the whole screen.
