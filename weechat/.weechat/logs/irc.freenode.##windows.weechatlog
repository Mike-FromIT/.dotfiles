2018-06-17 22:26:52	pikajude	so without having an auxiliary device to send audio through, the system seems to compensate by just cutting off audio for a few seconds at randobm

2018-06-18 06:23:41	Sabotender	I changed the default location where programs are installed, but I noticed that some application installers have their install location hard-coded.

2018-06-18 06:46:50	BtbN	Does someone happen to know how Windows gets the name is assigns to a wired Network connection? It decided to name my wired network connection "eduroam"(I'm at a university), but I'd like to change that name, as it clashes with the Wifi also called eduroam, and I can't make the wired connection Private but Wifi public.
2018-06-18 06:49:01	Ussat	because thats the name, I also work at a Uni, and the "clashing" means nothing
2018-06-18 06:51:18	CptLuxx	its based on the dns prefix
2018-06-18 06:56:47	Sabotender	is there any way to prevent this message 'you need an app to use this overlay' from popping up when I play a game?
2018-06-18 06:57:11	CptLuxx	##windows
2018-06-18 06:57:16	CptLuxx	uh right
2018-06-18 06:57:25	CptLuxx	nvm
2018-06-18 06:57:47	BtbN	And the clashing does mean something, because it thinks the eduroam wireless network is the same Network as my wired one. So if I change my wired connection to private, it also changed the wireless eduroam to private at the same time.
2018-06-18 06:58:06	BtbN	The DNS suffix is the domain of my university

2018-06-18 07:05:08	BtbN	Why is this so hidden in general? The only way to even change the name seems to be via hacking around in registry keys.
2018-06-18 07:06:09	Sabotender	do you think it might be easier if I took a screenshot so you would know what I was referring to?
2018-06-18 07:06:38	TheBard	Sabotender, is it a Windows error message? or is it from the game engine?
2018-06-18 07:06:50	Sabotender	its a windows message
2018-06-18 07:08:36	TheBard	show a picture, it doesnt sound very Windows-like.
2018-06-18 07:09:36	CptLuxx	its the game mode
2018-06-18 07:09:41	CptLuxx	with the overlay i guess
2018-06-18 07:09:47	Sabotender	this is going to take a moment, I am still installing windows applications. I need to install dropbox so I can easily transfer screenshots
2018-06-18 07:09:51	Sabotender	lol moment please

2018-06-18 13:07:45	TheBard	are they plugged into a USB3 port?
2018-06-18 13:08:23	nate	pikajude: Your system is probably too new and uses a USB3 chipset if the USB2 ports don't work either.  Consult your vendor for BIOS/UEFI USB legacy updates or you'll have to build a slipstream Win7 install w/ the drivers built in
2018-06-18 13:08:40	pikajude	no, they're plugged into a USB2 port
2018-06-18 13:09:18	pikajude	i have Legacy USB Support enabled in my BIOS settings
2018-06-18 13:09:27	pikajude	i'm not sure if that's related to what you suggested or not
2018-06-18 13:10:02	nate	possibly not, there's kind of an explicit support.  When I had to get EVGA to give me an update they labeled it something like "Windows 7 legacy USB Support" explicitly
2018-06-18 13:10:13	pikajude	ooh ok
2018-06-18 13:10:46	malwar3hun73r	i'm trying to set a customshell in win10 and it seems like it's working, but the path is always set to c:\windows\system32 which dorks with my custom shell. Is there a way to set the path with a custom shell?
2018-06-18 13:10:51	nate	Problem is a lot of newer hardware technically route their USB2 ports through the USB3 chipset too just to save having a separate chipset so Win7 can't use it as it has no native USB3 drivers
2018-06-18 13:10:54	pikajude	huh, okay
2018-06-18 13:11:07	pikajude	so i enabled an option that claims to simulate a PS/2 connection for the kb/m
2018-06-18 13:11:09	pikajude	and it works now
2018-06-18 13:11:12	pikajude	hmmm
2018-06-18 13:11:35	BtbN	Even if you slipstream the drivers, you need a PS/2 keyboard to install
2018-06-18 13:11:39	malwar3hun73r	I've also tried a shortcut (never spawns the exe - just get a black background) and a bat file (which works, but spawns the custom shell over and over in a loop).

2018-06-18 13:15:14	pikajude	how do i make win10 installer install windows 7
2018-06-18 13:15:37	BtbN	the installer is surprisingly simple. It formats a disk and unpacks the .wim on it
2018-06-18 13:15:42	BtbN	and then boots what it just unpacked
2018-06-18 13:15:44	compdoc	dont see how you can
2018-06-18 13:16:04	BtbN	So you can totally just give the Win10 installer the Win7 .wim

2018-06-18 14:38:26	S_SubZero	That's never been what an upgrade does.  It makes windows.old and throws Windows in there, but then does an in-place "upgrade" of the currently installed OS.
2018-06-18 14:39:03	SJr	If my laptop came with Windows 10 Pro, and I wipe it and throw Linux on it. My understanding is that how my license (since it's pro and not home), lets me use Windows in a VM. My question is how do I actually do that? Do I just download an ISO from Microsoft and then get the product key from my old windows hdd?

2018-06-18 15:18:52	ScRaMbLe	DevilTiger_ reality is that most likely you have never did an upgrade - it was always fresh intall ontop of the current install (read the manual? don't miss click?)... I will go further and suggest that you tried to mix folders together and (between old + fresh install) hence the broken OS and this finally lead you here.

2018-06-18 17:21:44	pikajude	replacing the w10 install.wim with the w7 one
2018-06-18 17:21:53	pikajude	i'm probably about this close to just doing that
2018-06-18 17:21:58	ttim	but i think that could be also a lye towards old playstation players ;)
2018-06-18 17:22:11	pikajude	i can't even conceive of how the installer would be able to use my USB3 ports properly but the actual OS doesn't
2018-06-18 17:22:19	ttim	i think you should out some of that win7 usb stick with drivers creation tools

2018-06-18 17:22:36	ttim	no matter what board you have, the usb chipset should be either amd or intel...
2018-06-18 17:22:51	pikajude	the install.wim i created has the intel usb3 drivers
2018-06-18 17:22:54	ttim	so it should work no matter what mb you have if you got a stick with the chipset drivers...
2018-06-18 17:23:04	pikajude	but after the first installer reboot, mouse and keyboard don't exist anymore
2018-06-18 17:23:11	pikajude	and i don't know why
2018-06-18 17:23:29	ttim	yea, but dose it install the driver in the new system or just provides it with in the winPE?
2018-06-18 17:23:38	pikajude	i added the driver to boot.wim and install.wim

2018-06-18 17:24:13	ttim	so you need to integrate the driver also into the final installation...
2018-06-18 17:24:14	pikajude	but i thought the contents of install.wim were unpacked onto the hard drive
2018-06-18 17:24:26	ttim	what is that sugsessor of bcd live disc again
2018-06-18 17:24:35	ttim	maybe you could fix that problem with this
2018-06-18 17:25:12	pikajude	can you be more specific
2018-06-18 17:25:26	ttim	but i would suggest fist a clean reinstall with a propably build installation drive (just take that one of an gigabyte motherboard with the same chipset as your asus one...)
2018-06-18 17:25:34	ttim	i could if i had real internet

2018-06-18 18:40:11	Emery	Pretty sure Win7 was EOL 2015
2018-06-18 18:40:21	S_SubZero	it's a new build?  Is there anything invested in the installation so far?
2018-06-18 18:40:32	pikajude	not really, no
2018-06-18 18:40:33	Emery	Didn't think old junk was supported in here
2018-06-18 18:40:34	pikajude	i mean, there was
2018-06-18 18:40:50	S_SubZero	nuke and reinstall.  You'll need to find different USB3 drivers potentially
2018-06-18 18:40:53	pikajude	i had w10 running on this computer for awhile to varying degrees of success
2018-06-18 18:41:00	pikajude	but earlier today i reformatted by SSD
2018-06-18 18:41:02	pikajude	my*
2018-06-18 18:41:10	pikajude	to facilitate the installation process
2018-06-18 18:41:14	S_SubZero	if Win10 didn't run flawlessly, that machine has some weird issue.
2018-06-18 18:41:18	Emery	Laughing Out Loud
2018-06-18 18:41:25	pikajude	ok
2018-06-18 18:42:17	Emery	Windows 10 is much more than just DX12, Win7 is EOL, not to mention drivers and the likes
2018-06-18 18:42:29	Emery	I mean does NVDIA and the likes still support that rubbish with new updates?
2018-06-18 18:43:34	epicmetal	win7 isn't eol yet
2018-06-18 18:43:38	S_SubZero	Win7 is in extended support until 2020.
2018-06-18 18:43:55	pikajude	yeah, and it's listed as supporting skylake
2018-06-18 18:43:59	Emery	Not to mention if you think running windows 7 on a rig like that because it's "lightweight" will be better off seems pretty dumb
2018-06-18 18:44:00	pikajude	so i'm not sure what the issue here can be
2018-06-18 18:45:07	S_SubZero	last time I used Win7 was in.. 2012.. so I can't be any more help with that really, as I never even used Win7 on a USB3 system
2018-06-18 18:45:28	Emery	He's running a nice mobo, DDR4 and the likes

2018-06-18 18:45:33	pikajude	i asked asus support what the deal is with the USB2 ports on this mobo and they said it's expected to support windows 7 out of the box
2018-06-18 18:45:34	pikajude	lmao
2018-06-18 18:45:36	Emery	I have no idea why he wants to run old rubbish
2018-06-18 18:45:40	Emery	But whatever
2018-06-18 18:45:50	S_SubZero	Win7 should support USB2.

2018-06-18 18:46:23	pikajude	must be the mobo's fault

2018-06-18 18:50:20	Emery	Have you tried another USB stick?
2018-06-18 18:50:31	pikajude	ok this is more trouble than it's worth, i'm gonna stick with w10

2018-06-19 09:13:04	jcondor	Hi there, can you help me with a problem? I took off an HDD from a Windows XP machine to save some files and reformat everything (in a Windows 10 machine). The Windows XP machine was working when the HDD was in. Unfortunately, under Win 10 it was't possible to copy the files I need because the owner is SYSTEM. So I opened the cmd and launched a recursive 'takeown' command, and not only it is still
2018-06-19 09:13:06	jcondor	impossible to copy the stuff, but the dimension of the folder now is inexplicably about 4 times bigger!

If you’re looking for a more appropriate channel you can use freenode's "alis" tool, with the command /msg alis help or ask #freenode.

If you’re looking for a more appropriate channel you can use freenode's "alis" tool, with the command /msg alis help or check out this regularly updated freenode channel search tool.

2018-06-23 13:01:00	CptLuxx	avast had more then enough time to test there product

2018-06-23 13:02:03	nate	But personally I largely put the fault on microsoft as they made the decision to stop doing internal QA on popular security tools and start using the customers as a testing bed for updates, avast didn't make microsoft do that :P
2018-06-23 13:02:35	CptLuxx	100% avast faults ..
2018-06-23 13:02:47	nate	Everyone has an opinion, to each their own lol
2018-06-23 13:02:59	DLSteve	Why I stick to defender and not 3rd party AV. Many AV programs can be worse than having no AV as they introduce new attack vectors with ring 0 access.
2018-06-23 13:03:02	nate	largely an off topic matter in here anyways at this point I think

2018-06-23 13:23:50	nate	CptLuxx: Like I said, unbiased (or perhaps 'proper' data would be a better phrase).  Problem with them in particular is they include internal/vendor-provided statistics as well as daily explicitly up-to-date purely Win10 as well (ie; not most consumer average environments).  Admittedly the latter they openly note, they also note that they mostly just look from a rough web viewing perspective
2018-06-23 13:24:29	nate	ie; malware that actually makes it through a browser 3rd party plugin or possibly finds a system level vulnerability via the browser, not actively downloading/running/etc like a lot of common consumer users would
2018-06-23 13:24:42	nate	so the results are pretty skewed to not general usage statistics
2018-06-23 13:25:23	nate	And vendor-provided statistics/data is obviously gonna undoubtedly be skewed to their side, they've all been known to do it, especially microsoft :P

2018-06-24 08:30:26	weq	One consideration, you need enterprise or education sku. Hardware is a different considaration. All of these are listed and what reference points you should take into account if choosing to go with windows to go are pretty much covered in those articles.

But if I would like to set different policies to each of them? How does policy profile know which file it will work with(ie. chrome.exe vs chromium.exe)?

2018-06-25 21:19:01	cyberjames	Hi. I have TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 enabled. How can I make 1.2 as default TLS version on Windows 2008?
2018-06-25 21:20:19	nate	cyberjames: By disabling 1.0 and 1.1 ciphers.  Ultimately the client chooses the cipher generally, not the server, despite that the server can specify a 'preferred order' usually.  However most clients will always utilize the strongest cipher available (which would mean TLS1.2 if the client supported it)
2018-06-25 21:20:29	nate	Past that, probably wanna ask in ##windows-server

2018-06-25 21:23:58	nate	Are you trying to enact it on IIS or?  Generally just the software involved needs a restart
2018-06-25 21:24:06	cyberjames	yeah IIS
2018-06-25 21:24:25	nate	However do keep in mind disabling TLS 1.0 and 1.1 may restrict your accessibility as there's still semi-modern things that don't support TLS 1.2, not many but
2018-06-25 21:24:32	cyberjames	basically I have app running on IIS that needs to use TLS 1.2
2018-06-25 21:24:58	magic_ninja1	naphtali, yes, that is it. There are no drivers, or an incorrect driver each time. And yea, I checked the event viewer, but I couldn't find anything in it
2018-06-25 21:25:23	magic_ninja1	I'm having a few serious issues with windows 10 that are interrupting my work.
2018-06-25 21:25:24	cyberjames	I see, if there is a way I can set on IIS that this app must use version 1.2, that would be good rather than disabling 1.0, and 1.1
2018-06-25 21:26:05	naphtali	magic_ninja1, what type of device has the driver issue?

2018-06-25 22:19:18	MoPac	Hello. I'm hoping to get some insight into the mechanics of MS Office licences (2016, not 360) that are shipped with OEM Win 10 machines these days -- in this case my partner's HP laptop. They have no user-visible product keys; they're just supposed to activate themselves upon setup.
2018-06-25 22:23:36	MoPac	This one never activated during setup, and neither HP nor Microsoft seems to have any idea of how to trigger an activation now (and they're not interested in refuding the money). Someone has suggested a Windows reset/reinstall, but I wonder if that might delete the very thingi that we're trying to get the system to use

2018-06-25 22:24:21	MoPac	On the other hand, if what's going on is just that HP has given MS some hardware ID information authorizing the machine to activate a license, then maybe a reset or whatever Windows calls it would be the right way to go

2018-06-25 23:44:47	myxenovia	It sounds like explorer has stopped but when i run it in task manager nothing comes out
2018-06-25 23:45:48	RingtailedFox	i sometimes get that problem... it's rare, but usually, that's becuase there's multiple explorer processes running (one for handling explorer windows, the other for the desktop interface itself).. killing both, then restarting explorer usually fixes it.... so does logging out and back in, too :P

2018-06-26 05:26:09	iodev	kirk781: how?
2018-06-26 05:26:17	iodev	with add-ons?
2018-06-26 05:26:32	iodev	or does it only show Bing ads?
2018-06-26 05:27:19	kirk781	iodev, they built in Adblock Plus[with it's acceptable ads option intact]in Edge
2018-06-26 05:27:35	iodev	can I turn off "acceptable"
2018-06-26 05:27:39	kirk781	Edge is still bulky; but atleast looks good in dark mode

2018-06-26 05:28:00	kirk781	I tried it again today; it's still slightly slow but usable now
2018-06-26 05:28:00	iodev	so I can block everything?

2018-06-26 05:28:25	kirk781	iodev, well, I guess yes, in as much Adblock can actually block
2018-06-26 05:28:33	kirk781	iodev, I also run the same configuration
2018-06-26 05:28:45	iodev	is it just as good?
2018-06-26 05:28:56	iodev	can it play HTML5 videos? (edge I mean)
2018-06-26 05:29:03	kirk781	iodev, I didn't run into any obvious ads that got displayed

2018-06-26 11:52:41	flying_sausages	I'm hoping that something like outlook://shared-calendar-xyz will basically open up outlook and show the shared calendar xyz

2018-06-26 11:55:53	Nekomander	flying_sausages, try this: https://www.google.com/search?q=outlook+protocol+url
2018-06-26 11:56:14	Nekomander	The "protocol" keyword might give you better results.
2018-06-26 11:56:20	Tin_man	i kinda do that, but with 2 different systems, 1 my linux I watch youtube on, and my windows i use for everything else, my desk isn't big enough for 2 side by side though
2018-06-26 11:58:45	flying_sausages	Nekomander, ah looks like it's been discontinued in 2007

2018-06-26 14:32:16	DrPlacebo	Hi guys. I'm another person with the "New and full D: drive after Win10 April 2018 update" problem, in which the recovery partition becomes visible and causes an annoying notification. I know there is a fix for this using diskpart, but I'm not too confident in this and don't really wanna do it because I've accidentally wiped recovery partitions before.
2018-06-26 14:32:32	DrPlacebo	Do you guys think an update will come out soon that will fix this, or are Microsoft expecting us to fix this one ourselves? I updates a cululative update today, but this wasn't fixed :(

2018-07-19 18:40:37	Samian	can someone explain this business of registered a dll with windows?
2018-07-19 18:40:49	Samian	I thought as long as the dll is in the same folder as the exe, the dll should be found
2018-07-19 18:41:00	Samian	is that not true?

2018-07-19 18:49:31	naphtali	Samian, jcotton or Stryyker could better answer you but registering a DLL sets a path in the registry to the DLL and also lets the OS know what it's capabilities are. Depending on how the .exe is designed, it may look to the registry and not just it's own folder to find the DLLs it needs

2018-07-19 20:05:37	Samian	Client wants to have both old version and new version of software. However, new version software loads old version's dll file that is incompatible and ignores it's own dll in the same folder as itself. Any idea why?
2018-07-19 20:06:21	kez|unauth	its because of however the vendor programmed their software, there could be any number of different reasons you would have to load it up into a debugger to figure out why
2018-07-19 20:06:40	kez|unauth	it's probably easier to have each version of the software operate in it's own environment
2018-07-19 20:06:56	Samian	darn that would mean debugging on their box
2018-07-19 20:07:22	kez|unauth	if it's simple software it's own directory with it's own shortcut, but if the different versions have different conflicting registry entries or user profile specific settings (%appdata%) then you might have to use more advanced sandboxing techniques.

2018-07-19 20:33:03	kez|noauthed	anyway back to your question: if it's windows 10, depending on the version and I admit that I havent worked with it enough yet to be sure, there is the ability to run different pieces of software in different environments. you would essentially have to treat each version of the software as a completely separate installation of that software so that each one doesn't try to use the other's dependencies
2018-07-19 20:33:26	kez|noauthed	old version only uses it's stuff, new version only uses it's stuff, all kept separate.

2018-07-19 20:36:40	Zythyr	Hi. Need help with Windows drivers. I have a scientfic device which connects to PC using USB. The issue is that on Windows 7 I am easily able to connect device using USB. On Windows 10 I am unable to connect. Device Manager says "unknown usb device (device failed enumeration)". I have the drivers installed provided by the vendor. Note: The software is designed for Windows 7, however on Windows
2018-07-19 20:36:40	Zythyr	10 the software works, only issue is that Windows won't connect the device
2018-07-19 20:37:34	kez|noauthed	it sounds like windows 10 is saying the windows 7 driver's aren't compatible. There is a way that you can force windows 10 to try and use the windows 7 drivers.

2018-07-19 20:53:52	kez|blah	AFAIK none of the built in restore options that come with the OS are the same as installing from an ISO or a vendor provided recovery partition. I've also seen instances where a vendor provided recovery partition has been tampered with after-the-fact by hostile software.
2018-07-19 20:53:53	Budgii	Okay. I may try and get the iso then, I think i may have some malicious software on my machine. I cleared what it was with AVG and Malware bytes, but still would rather be safe and do a full reset.
2018-07-19 20:54:06	kez|blah	read-only recovery media is the only way to be 100% sure :)

2018-07-19 20:54:39	sepeck	it is essentially the same
2018-07-19 20:54:57	sepeck	it all depends on why you what to.  a reset will be just fine

2018-07-20 06:28:57	TheBard	I deleted VLC, but Windows still has a blank icon on the taskbar, including a list of recent files. Even after a reboot.
2018-07-20 06:32:30	TheBard	part of the problem I had yesterday was that somehow VLC changed the 'type' listing for audio files in Windows.
2018-07-20 06:33:02	TheBard	for example, .aif and .wav files were listed as VLC Audio files.  So a sort by file type no longer worked.

2018-07-20 14:58:42	digiphi	system16: You could wait until 7 is officially unsupported or start running some hardware compatibilty checks for 10 :)
2018-07-20 14:58:44	system16	oh ok. so my only option is to find a ddr2 2 GB ram stick.
2018-07-20 14:58:57	digiphi	o_O
2018-07-20 14:59:09	system16	to upgrade to 4 GB
2018-07-20 14:59:19	digiphi	That should suffice.

2018-07-20 14:59:38	digiphi	2GB of RAM is like having a rope slightly tightened around your neck.
2018-07-20 14:59:44	ntd	w10 solved w8/8.1s major issue, the "start screen". but of they had to frak it up. telemetry, surprise app installs, etc
2018-07-20 15:00:04	digiphi	ntd: Yea, that telemetry crap I'm NOT cool with.
2018-07-20 15:00:13	system16	well. i had that windows upgrade assistant thing. it said that my PC can support the latest ver. of win10
2018-07-20 15:00:23	digiphi	Which is why I dropped Windows altogher (aside from learning newer technologies) and went with Linux.
2018-07-20 15:00:32	system16	digiphi, my pc has 3 GB of ram. not 2

2018-07-20 15:00:59	digiphi	Yea.
2018-07-20 15:01:25	system16	installing kaspersky on this was a bad idea lol
2018-07-20 15:01:44	digiphi	Windows 10 has its own Windows Defender.
2018-07-20 15:02:01	system16	yeah and thats gonna do nothing
2018-07-20 15:02:17	digiphi	Sometimes those 3rd party anti-virus softwares are filled with bloatware.
2018-07-20 15:02:24	ntd	sometimes?
2018-07-20 15:02:35	digiphi	system16: Uhh, you should reconsider that.
2018-07-20 15:02:46	digiphi	ntd: haha

2018-07-20 17:12:06	geezr-butlr	When my laptop goes to sleep, the only way to turn it on again is by using the power button. This is a bit abnormal, since I am used to laptops turning themselves on when you open their lid. That doesn't really bother me though. What I'd like to be able to do is wake the computer on when it is plugged in to my USB keyboard (by pressing some keys).
2018-07-20 17:12:07	geezr-butlr	Currently I have to open the lid and press the power button when it is asleep in desktop mode. Any idea how I can enable this? I've looked in power options but I must be missing something.

2018-07-20 17:49:44	geezr_butlr	Well, I looked thoroughly through the BIOS options, and looked up Windows 10 guides on how to accomplish it. There's a massive amount of threads of my computer's line dating back five years of people having this problem. So I guess it just isn't possible for my hardware. Very disappointing as it's supposed to be a top of the line machine (Dell XPS
2018-07-20 17:49:44	geezr_butlr	15). Right now the only solution I can think of is to make the computer stay in sleep mode for 24 hours and only hibernate after that. At least it will make me have to open the lid much less often (since I usually use the computer once per day). I hope this doesn't have an adverse affect on the health of my battery though long term.

2018-07-21 01:50:16	S_SubZero	maybe you have the drives in a weird order.  Typically the mass storage would be on SATA0.

2018-07-21 01:53:47	S_SubZero	I’ll guess that when you play with the controller, you are throwing the disk numbering scheme around, and Windows really likes booting from SATA0 and tends to be unhappy when it is told it’s something else.

2018-07-21 05:34:38	fly_agaric	i didnt really remove it
2018-07-21 05:34:40	yoyoyooo	the jumper is a bridge, once broken, the battery line is cut, therefore there is no real reason to remove that battery.
2018-07-21 05:34:43	yoyoyooo	Aaaah
2018-07-21 05:34:52	yoyoyooo	That's good then

2018-07-21 05:44:07	yoyoyooo	fly_agaric: Also, may I recommend ##hardware as I don't think you fully understand what a BIOS is and how it works.
2018-07-21 05:44:17	fly_agaric	btw i tried to google the hwid but no single result
2018-07-21 05:44:24	yoyoyooo	You have a misconception that Windows is the key.
2018-07-21 05:44:43	fly_agaric	yoyo i know what the bios is....
2018-07-21 05:44:58	yoyoyooo	Then I must be wrong.
2018-07-21 05:45:01	fly_agaric	i just know that driver updates can come with win update including bios

2018-07-21 05:47:50	yoyoyooo	However, Windows may have BIOS drivers so it can read the BIOS and post information about it back to the enduser, but that's all.
2018-07-21 05:48:32	fly_agaric	you can update the bios with the vendor tools inside windows
2018-07-21 05:48:50	fly_agaric	why do you think windows update cant do that if it downloads a wrong bios flash tool?
2018-07-21 05:49:00	yoyoyooo	But Windows itself has no direct access to the ROM, these tools are wrote to provide that access, and it's them alone that do it.

2018-07-21 05:50:21	Stryyker	Although a few months ago some were busted for having faulty signature checks.
2018-07-21 05:52:47	yoyoyooo	Personally, I don't see the point in updating BIOS roms, as they generally support everything on your board anyway.

2018-07-21 06:10:30	yoyoyooo	(Windows Apache MySQL PHP), it is basically Windows, with a web server (apache2) on top, along with MySQL (A database server), along with PHP which makes Mediawiki and other PHP applications happen

2018-07-21 06:13:24	yoyoyooo	All you have to do is get it serving Mediawiki.
2018-07-21 06:13:43	rosco_y	I like MySql, havn't used PHP though. (Although I understand it wouldn't hurt to get on board with PHP, with the hundreds of thousands of user-libraries and such.)
2018-07-21 06:14:36	yoyoyooo	PHP has it's ups and downs, however the downs are irrelevant to the industry as it is the most use web language in the industry, because it is so easy to learn.

2018-07-21 10:51:24	jelly	sadly no, that would probably be a better upgrade
2018-07-21 10:51:40	blkshp	tbh my sarcasm aside, you would likely see little return, but it would be a fresh clean installation. I cannot overstate how much difference an SSD would make

2018-07-21 11:29:43	blkshp	Its a personal preference that linux users (including myself) want. Most Windows only users seem to be quite happy with the white explorer. its perfectly normal for it to be white and "eye sore" is a little harsh.
2018-07-21 11:30:01	CountryfiedLinux	blkshp, I mean the color of the window border. For everything else I can set the window border to have the color scheme, but with Edge there's only light and dark, which are gray and black. Can't make it green.
2018-07-21 11:30:28	blkshp	mine's red on 1803 so not sure what you are doing wrong.
2018-07-21 11:30:30	Tin_man	I used the dark theme on the insider program, it was nice.. will be nice this fall when it comes out.

2018-07-21 19:11:34	system16	turn it on ?
2018-07-21 19:12:17	Tin_man	i up vote the turn it on.

2018-07-21 19:13:35	Tin_man	might poke around and see what turned it off, really don't know where to look though
2018-07-21 19:13:59	system16	xuzzle, install some 3th party second opinion scanners

2018-07-21 19:15:12	xuzzle	I didn't have anything else on it. It was new system. Thought Windows Defender would be good enough for an os update. (Usually on mac or linux. Not sure what the expect with windows.)

2018-07-22 09:45:12	copypaste	I'm dealing with a problem that is making me wonder whether I should just give up and reinstall the OS. Rather than do that, I figured, ask the experts: so here I am. I have a Windows 10 PC that absolutely will not eject any device. No, this is not the typical, you have some program open and it gives you an error saying it's in use, this is bizarre. The OS doesn't react at all. No error, no "disk removed".
2018-07-22 09:45:14	copypaste	Disk still showed as inserted, and I can read/write to it no matter how many times I hit "eject". Shady third party utilities simply freeze and Windows asks me if I want to kill them or keep waiting. If I go ahead and yank it out, it shows as "Unreadable" in disk management, yet still shows in Windows Explorer, just as an empty unwritable drive. If I try to replug it, there's seemingly nothing I can do to
2018-07-22 09:45:16	copypaste	get Windwos to mount it again

2018-07-22 13:39:50	tonsofpcs	I don't think it's that it's a "not connected device" but it's a "removed device" that network manager remembered settings for.  I just ignored the warning and it's working fine but it bothers me that there's no obvious way to delete it other than deleting the network preferences remembering trees matching its UID in the registry...

Windows7 has a registry tweak to enable UTC time, but it's buggy so I don't want to use it. Is there a free & clean system tray clock replacement that can show the time as a particular locale or GMT+2?

2018-07-23 13:56:44	epictetus	mark russinovich had a really interesting article where he basically tore down everything microsoft _claims_ sysprep does / why it is necessary vs. what it really does (which was unclear) with the overall conclusion that sysprep is the recommended process and you should use it regardless of whether or not it has anything to do with SIDs/what microsoft claims it is for
2018-07-23 13:57:55	epictetus	but yeah it's really interesting if you've ever dealt with large scale system image deployment in a linux / open source environment and then come over to Windows and it's like... "WOW, that's a lot of extra steps every single time a system gets cloned"
2018-07-23 13:58:13	weq	"new sid" is a myth though there have been 3rd party solutions how have made their entire licensing model around sid which is not the proper method of developing a licensing strategy.
2018-07-23 13:59:00	weq	and wrong epictetus, know exactly what sysprep does. It removes everything that is machine specific for that instance. That would be drivers e.g.
2018-07-23 13:59:04	weq	we know*
2018-07-23 13:59:16	epictetus	weq: well mark russinovich disagrees

2018-07-23 14:00:10	weq	new sid is a myth. Though sysprep does a lot more than just that.
2018-07-23 14:00:34	epictetus	and "proper" has to do with what your goals are in the process... for instance if your point of cloning is related to, for instance, automated software testing where the goal is to get the most iterations of "test this on a fresh VM" into the least # of CPU cycles then sysprep might not be the best solution. if your goal is to deploy a well-supported MS OS using standard processes then sysprep is the only way to do it

2018-07-23 14:04:35	weq	for all that windows cares it reset what is needed. For whatever 3rd parties require is a different story. There have been AV enterprises solutions which registered the machine sids to ensure that "only 1" machine used it at the time. But in an enterprise environment windows itself has never had an issue with seeing different machines on the network with the same network. Except if you cloned an already

2018-07-23 15:14:18	Tencryn	Hi. This has happened over several installs of Windows, and it's only a relatively recent issue. Probably a week or so. Sometimes when UAC pops up, it will reduce my volume... but all the volume settings are as they should be. In the case of headphones, replugging them will fix it. Any ideas what this could be?
2018-07-23 15:15:35	Tencryn	Note that the volume doesn't reduce any other time. Only when UAC pops up and it affects everything.
2018-07-23 15:15:40	TheBard	you mean while the popup is there? or after you dismiss it?
2018-07-23 15:16:17	streuner	Hello! Will windows 10 be really last edition of Windows?
2018-07-23 15:16:17	Tencryn	Both. You know how you get that "dung" kinda sound when it pops up? That's quiet and after closing UAC, all volume is quiet.
2018-07-23 15:16:28	TheBard	streuner, ask Microsoft.

2018-07-23 15:18:07	TheBard	Tencryn, is it a laptop?

2018-07-23 22:34:06	zyme	Diamondcite: I would imagine, so long as you don't change the config of the 32GB partition it makes - then you should be able to add additional partitions on the USB drive
2018-07-23 22:35:45	zyme	A fat 32GB partition Makes me assume it's probably a MBR (as opposed to GPT) partition table, and the partition it makes is the active partition so it'll boot off it..

2018-07-23 22:36:17	keithweisshar	should i avoid 64gb+ drives when using mct
2018-07-23 22:36:36	zyme	43GB was the original size limit, but I thought they made FAT32 capable of much larger partitions a long time ago
2018-07-23 22:36:47	zyme	43 = 32GB I mean
2018-07-23 22:36:49	keithweisshar	should i only use 32gb or smaller when using mct
2018-07-23 22:37:25	Nautilus	quick look via google, it's a limit in mct at least
2018-07-23 22:37:49	keithweisshar	why won't they change it to support both fat32 and ntfs
2018-07-23 22:38:01	keithweisshar	two partitions
2018-07-23 22:38:17	keithweisshar	windows 10 version 1703 or later support multiple partitions on usb flash drives
2018-07-23 22:38:47	zyme	If I remember correctly if the OS boot files happened to be further into the drive sectors then 32GB it wouldn't boot though.. but that was with a traditional HDD who knows how systems read flash storage when mixing up old storage tech with these new devices...

2018-07-24 01:47:37	blkshp	are you trying to chuck Windows 7 on an SSD from an HDD?
2018-07-24 01:47:44	jada	blkshp that's right
2018-07-24 01:48:09	jada	I'm using Acronis bootable USB thumbdrive for that, doing 'disk clone'
2018-07-24 01:48:12	blkshp	PRobably wont work, Windows 7 by default does not include an SSD driver. iirc (=but windows 7 is so old that i dont really recall)
2018-07-24 01:48:46	Nautilus	jada if it seems to clone ok but doesn't boot, swap so the SSD is native in the laptop and clone from the external
2018-07-24 01:48:48	jada	that windows detected the drive while in USB3.0 enclosure, does that matter?

2018-07-24 01:49:22	blkshp	i havent done it (due to the age of it) but just wanted to present the warning.
2018-07-24 01:49:39	Nautilus	i did it last week
2018-07-24 01:49:44	Stryyker	Windows 7 has some SSD optimisations - it is a little aware of SSDs.
2018-07-24 01:50:12	Stryyker	Some free tools offer to try and do it from Windows. Easeus sometimes has a free tool for moving device. What size HDD and what size SSD?
2018-07-24 01:50:18	Stryyker	also make of SSD
2018-07-24 01:50:30	jada	HDD is 500GB, SSD is SanDisk 240GB
2018-07-24 01:50:40	jada	acronis at least in theory allows me to resize partition
2018-07-24 01:50:54	Nautilus	it does
2018-07-24 01:50:56	jada	the 500GB drive is nearly empty anyway, it just has clean win7 install on it
2018-07-24 01:51:18	nate	Windows 7 works with SSD's fine w/ the service pack (which it would be weird if you don't have)
2018-07-24 01:51:28	Stryyker	Clean install? Probably easier to install to the SSD then.
2018-07-24 01:51:40	jada	I don't have installation media :/
2018-07-24 01:51:49	jada	I have serial code though, it's OEM thingy I think
2018-07-24 01:51:54	Stryyker	ouch

2018-07-24 06:32:47	PapaSmurf	Hi. I have a computer with a built in mouse you use by lightly moving your finger the way you want the curser to go. However today it seems to be "fighting" me. It does menus by itself and adjusts screen size when I don't want it to. If I scroll left or right it attempts to do the opposite also upon start up it does not display the password strip when I tap the screen sometimes
2018-07-24 06:32:56	Stryyker	Free space may be an issue. Defrag Tools on channel9.msdn.com had a video about some troubleshooting in the last month or so

Is it safe enough to get an snapshot? Is a snapshot exactly equals to the drive itself? Do you have any recommendation on tools to take an snapshot?

2018-07-26 19:42:33	jcotton	you can also have it copy the OS files and drivers so you can use it to start from scratch
2018-07-26 19:43:22	u63	how do i do that? will it ask me when i create the recovery drive or is it included by default?
2018-07-26 19:43:54	jcotton	there's a checkbox

2018-07-27 06:50:33	TheBard	what I mean is that on login, I want my n-number of apps to launch.  To do that currently requires advanced skills.
2018-07-27 06:51:08	TheBard	same with things like Macros.
2018-07-27 06:51:26	TheBard	what a time-saver it would be to have that feature back.

2018-07-27 06:51:50	weq	this makes no sense imo.
2018-07-27 06:52:56	TheBard	If Hello knows it is me and only me, it should launch all the apps I want, maybe even customizable by day or time, and run macros that adjust window positions, chrome sizes, launch commands, mouse clicks. Everything.
2018-07-27 06:53:00	weq	when logging in you can have whatever application be automatically started by using a plenthora of methods.
2018-07-27 06:53:18	TheBard	those methods are deliberately buried.
2018-07-27 06:53:44	weq	That is not the purpose of windows hello nor should it be imo.
2018-07-27 06:54:07	TheBard	then I have no idea what purpose you think it has.
2018-07-27 06:54:08	weq	There are launch tools that offer such functions.
2018-07-27 06:55:17	TheBard	the point of a full featured OS is to be intuitive to all users.  If I type 'startup' in Cortana, I am in no way lead to any method to add an app to Startup.
2018-07-27 06:55:46	weq	Windows Hello is for simplifying authentication. Not for launching apps. There are other solutions for that.
2018-07-27 06:57:00	TheBard	the cost of the technology, cameras, fingerprint sensors, complex facial rec software development just to save the user from typing the word 'pencil' does not justify its existance.  IMO.

2018-07-27 07:03:12	weq	https://github.com/nullpo-head/WSL-Hello-sudo <- this makes WSL so much bearable without needing to configuring sudo in WSL into a manner I deem unsecure personally.

2018-07-27 08:23:50	Zexaron	I see a lot of scripts about "if it's above 10.0.14939" and stuff like that, as well as 10.0.*

2018-07-27 14:31:50	NinjaStyle	Nah your permissions must be messed up
2018-07-27 14:32:21	NinjaStyle	Unless your local admin has the same password or something
2018-07-27 14:32:30	weq	havenstance: username doesn't really matter, SIDs matter.
2018-07-27 14:32:42	br34k	NinjaStyle, no, i have only domain\it, server\administrator, and anonymous no permissions
2018-07-27 14:32:50	br34k	once i removed administrator the issue went away
2018-07-27 14:33:07	weq	but the administrator will always be able to grant himself permissions again fyi.
2018-07-27 14:33:23	br34k	but even a local administrator that isn't even on the domain????
2018-07-27 14:33:44	weq	br34k: A local administrator has complete access to all local resources.
2018-07-27 14:33:56	weq	you need to be more specific in what & where...
2018-07-27 14:34:00	NinjaStyle	Even on the domain, the local admin account still exists
2018-07-27 14:34:23	havenstance	weq, sounds like he's having an issue with a non-domain user/pc being able to access domain shares
2018-07-27 14:34:28	br34k	this is a completely separate admin account though, off the domain

2018-07-27 14:34:32	br34k	exactly
2018-07-27 14:34:47	havenstance	br34k, so the pc your troubleshooting is NOT a member of the domain correct?
2018-07-27 14:34:49	NinjaStyle	Is the local admin password the same?
2018-07-27 14:35:02	br34k	havenstance, correct

2018-07-27 14:35:07	br34k	NinjaStyle, no
2018-07-27 14:35:14	weq	Where are these shares? is it on the same machine as the local account?
2018-07-27 14:35:14	br34k	not cached either
2018-07-27 14:35:17	NinjaStyle	Then it doesn't make sense
2018-07-27 14:35:22	br34k	no, on the LAN
2018-07-27 14:35:40	weq	ok since you aren't specific enough I'm out of this.
2018-07-27 14:35:42	NinjaStyle	That's not how windows works, so your permissions must be wide open or something
2018-07-27 14:35:42	havenstance	and so if for instance they go to //xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/sharename their able to access and bypass the request for credentials right?
2018-07-27 14:35:55	br34k	havenstance, exactly
2018-07-27 14:38:05	havenstance	what version of windows is your server running? and what is this client box running?
2018-07-27 14:38:41	havenstance	to make the answer short, I'd check the share permissions in the network, it sounds like it's set to allow everyone access with full control, change, and read permissions
2018-07-27 14:39:57	havenstance	and that password protected sharing might be shut off, as NinjaStyle stated, in order for this to happen your permissions have to be set wide open somehow

2018-07-28 01:54:41	fishguts	Hi all. Trying to debug a problem with Windows lockups. I have investigated the possibility of using xperf, but once the lock up occurs I cannot write the trace to disk.
2018-07-28 01:55:44	fishguts	I looked flushing the xperf buffer to disk repeatedly, but always miss the moment as the final flushing does not happen once the lock up occurs. What tool can I use to debug this?
2018-07-28 01:57:38	fishguts	The symptoms are, while streaming a video from the desktop PC (Windows 10) to a Plex client, the video stops playing on client and Windows becomes unresponsive (I can move the mouse around and click buttons in Chrome and explorer et cetera, but can't open any new programs and already open programs are unresponsive).
2018-07-28 01:57:40	fishguts	Thanks.

2018-07-28 02:07:58	fishguts	Thanks. I should have mentioned it occasionally happens under light use also.
2018-07-28 02:08:06	fishguts	Temperatures are normal.
2018-07-28 02:09:08	fishguts	I am primarily interested in knowing how to record any information that might help in diagnosing the issue. If I can move the mouse around then maybe the OS can write info to the disk post-lockup, or can perhaps write some elucidating info just before the lockup.
2018-07-28 02:10:46	fishguts	I have replaced the motherboard and the ram and also removed the GPU. I am considering replacing the hard drive (with an older model - temporarily) but thought it would be easier to find the actual problem.

2018-07-28 06:47:28	Groar	win 10 is stuck in 99% with a cumulative update, been like this for 30 minutes
2018-07-28 06:47:35	Groar	has it died?
2018-07-28 06:47:36	Stryyker	AV is something people will fight about forever
2018-07-28 06:47:43	Stryyker	Is the disk showing activity?
2018-07-28 06:47:46	Groar	yeah
2018-07-28 06:48:04	Groar	it sounds "brrrrrr", haha
2018-07-28 06:48:23	Stryyker	Sounds like it is doing something then
2018-07-28 06:48:39	Groar	yeah but not sure if it makes that sound because of the update or because of random windows stuff
2018-07-28 06:48:54	Groar	hdd tends to be more silent on linux ;P
2018-07-28 06:48:56	catpig	personally i have been using defender without problem for at least 1.5 years. i do intend to switch to something else but not due to a solid technical reason so let#s not discuss that part ^^
2018-07-28 06:49:01	fishguts	catpig: Ah yes. Didn't think about that. Funny I've recently spent hours trying to get my X62 Thinkpad *into* lower C-states under Linux, whereas here I'm needing to achieve the opposite, apparently.
2018-07-28 06:49:02	catpig	i would keep waiting
2018-07-28 06:49:55	catpig	if there is disk activity (especially if it's a HDD, and not an SSD) i would give it at least 2 hours without visible progress
2018-07-28 06:50:17	Groar	wow

2018-07-28 06:51:22	Groar	yeah
2018-07-28 06:51:46	catpig	that's actually good. it seems pretty strange for it to give no feedback of progress for such a long time on a cumulative update
2018-07-28 06:51:57	catpig	if its a feature update dont worry

2018-07-28 11:15:30	CrazyCow9	there's no point in discussing it tho, the option to customise it isn't there period. If we're lucky they'll include it in the next version, if we're not well don't buy Windows. Plenty of options out  there. I personally hope for the former cause win10 is super good and stable.

2018-07-28 11:15:44	S_SubZero	I don’t notice.  I use my PC, when I go to shut down it has “install updates and shut down” so I do that, then I power it on and it comes up, updated.  /shrug.

Can anyone point me to some information about windows installer behavior about partitions?

2018-07-28 14:16:11	metrixx	jcotton, I would do that but out network has many restrictions and I can't connect some necessary servers without joining active directory. and I can't add VM to active directory because network throws me into a guest network automatically
2018-07-28 14:16:36	jcotton	but you're just testing the framework detection logic of the instalelr

2018-07-28 14:24:55	CptLuxx	Coding Coding/programming questions should be directed towards development channels such as ##windows-coding ##XAML ##csharp #win32 #winapi etc or a channel specific to your programming language. If you’re looking for a more appropriate channel you can use freenode's "alis" tool, with the command /msg alis help or check out this regularly updated freenode channel search tool.

2018-07-28 19:36:58	jcotton	yeah that's my thought

2018-07-28 20:45:28	xau	I'd like to get clarity on how Win10 shots down.  I've been told that selecting "power down" in Win10 actually puts the machine into hibernation.
2018-07-28 20:45:56	jcotton	it sorta does
2018-07-28 20:45:57	xau	Is this true?  My motive for asking relates to a fail I've encountered creating volume imaging
2018-07-28 20:46:00	xau	aha
2018-07-28 20:46:05	jcotton	certain parts of kernel memory are persisted to disk
2018-07-28 20:46:11	jcotton	this is used in Fast Startup
2018-07-28 20:46:16	jcotton	so turning it off disables that
2018-07-28 20:46:51	xau	The gist: I've done a system image of Win10 using Macrium Reflect.  The Macrium image, when restored, produces a system that boots, the goes into a self diagnostic loop ending in a dead end.
2018-07-28 20:47:34	xau	aha -- so if I want to turn off semi or quasi hibernation on power down, I need to find the fast start up setting and disable it.
2018-07-28 20:47:49	xau	it seems conceivable that this might fix the issue.
2018-07-28 20:48:09	xau	Meanwhile, I've got another issue today, one that straddles hardware and windows.  I'll put it out there -- please help if you can.
2018-07-28 20:48:18	jcotton	if you interrupt the boot sequence there's nowhere for windows to make a fast startup thing
2018-07-28 20:48:29	xau	aha
2018-07-28 20:48:31	jcotton	are you restoring this image to another system?
2018-07-28 20:48:52	xau	I'm restoring to the same system.
2018-07-28 20:49:09	xau	I'll dig further into that.  Multi-tasking here, here's the other issue:
2018-07-28 20:49:21	xau	again straddling hardware and Windows, so please help if you can
2018-07-28 20:50:21	xau	I've installed an SSD on my Win7 32 bit system which I really like using, and get great productivity out of, despite it being disparaged a lot these days (and of course being near its end of service)
2018-07-28 20:51:06	xau	but anyway: the SSD produces zero increased speed on that setup.  I've been advised by hardware guys that this is to be expected, that an SSD is not going to juice up the speed of Win7 32 bit.

2018-07-28 20:51:43	xau	It is an MX500, their latest offering

2018-07-28 20:52:44	xau	yeah
2018-07-28 20:53:10	xau	I'm perplexed.  Now: I did use Macrium reflect to migrate from my HDD to the SSD
2018-07-28 20:53:51	jcotton	personally i always clean install when switching drives, but that's just me
2018-07-28 20:53:53	xau	I did not use the Acronis sponsored tie in migration tool Crucial supplies (because it overtly puts phone home stuff on board)
2018-07-28 20:54:03	xau	Yes, I understand and agree.
2018-07-28 20:54:28	xau	And I will definitely at least get started on that.
2018-07-28 20:54:39	xau	As in do a clean install and then see how she flies
2018-07-28 20:54:43	xau	and take it from there
2018-07-28 20:55:03	jcotton	and migrate to 64bit at the same time

2018-07-28 20:55:07	xau	Also I can try putting early stage install images I took while building up the install

2018-07-28 20:55:24	xau	right?
2018-07-28 20:55:32	jcotton	they will still run
2018-07-28 20:55:37	xau	like 99% of them are going to work fine
2018-07-28 20:55:39	xau	yeah
2018-07-28 20:55:55	xau	So the gist.  If I care enough, I can start putting in the work.
2018-07-28 20:55:59	jcotton	the only issue would be devices that don't have 64-bit drivers, which shouldn't be an issue unless your machine was made at the very early stages of 64bit\
2018-07-28 20:56:13	xau	I get it.  I've given that guidance to enough people in my day.
2018-07-28 20:56:28	xau	It's an x200 from 2011
2018-07-28 20:56:52	jcotton	yeah you're good
2018-07-28 20:57:10	jcotton	how old is your 7 media? does it have SP1?
2018-07-28 20:57:38	xau	yeah, it's up to date to uh, April 2018
2018-07-28 20:57:43	jcotton	cool
2018-07-28 20:58:46	xau	even if I procrastinate, I've still got a drive that won't frag up now, so it'll prolly do video reprocessing and other stuff I do, a bit of photoshop and some language learning stuff, a bit cleaner
2018-07-28 20:59:07	xau	and it's there for when I decide to get the job done
2018-07-28 20:59:57	xau	tech upgrades usually supply initial disappointment and a learning curve + work required

2018-07-29 10:32:48	arha	all the languages have "Remove" enabled for the keyboard layouts, except the default system language
2018-07-29 10:32:53	arha	yep, already did.
2018-07-29 10:33:00	arha	but I do not want to make that language the System language
2018-07-29 10:33:07	arha	I just want the keyboard layout from that language
2018-07-29 10:33:08	weq	but then you can't remove it
2018-07-29 10:33:20	arha	ok, let me rephrase
2018-07-29 10:33:26	weq	Default system language MUST have a keyboard layout.
2018-07-29 10:33:42	arha	English system wide language: yes; English keyboard: no; Romanian programmers system wide language: no; Romanian keyboard layout: yes
2018-07-29 10:33:45	weq	There is nothing stopping you from using english windows and chinese keyboard language.
2018-07-29 10:34:07	weq	Just install romanian keyboard layout in the english language.
2018-07-29 10:34:18	weq	That is the new method you are supposed to do.
2018-07-29 10:34:29	weq	keyboard language are now nested UNDER the display language.
2018-07-29 10:34:29	arha	you could do this (I actually do this from a LTSB on another machine) from the "Language" in control panel
2018-07-29 10:34:52	weq	LTSB is a servicing channel. Has nothing to do with this. What you are referring to now is OLDER windows versions.
2018-07-29 10:34:59	weq	stop mixing that in. The regime has changed.
2018-07-29 10:35:11	weq	Install romanian UNDER english. done deal.
2018-07-29 10:35:12	weq	gone.
2018-07-29 10:35:14	arha	I'm sorry, I'm not familliar with regimes, channels or windows distribution methods
2018-07-29 10:35:23	arha	ok
2018-07-29 10:35:26	arha	I've done it that far
2018-07-29 10:35:34	arha	but now I wnat to remove the English keyboard layout
2018-07-29 10:35:42	arha	so everything systemwide defaults to RO
2018-07-29 10:37:04	arha	after doing what you've said (which I've also done), there are now two languages in the language bar

I did that and now I have a ubuntu install that is separate from my previous wsl. Any suggestions on how to get back to one install of wsl?

2018-07-30 02:27:05	baako	hi guys, my windows is stuck on bootload and the options to recover it or fix it doesnt work. I have tried everything on the internet and I might have made it worst. I do not want to refactory it has I have important documents I do not want to lose. I was wondering, if I put an installer usb or cd will it be able to repair from that?
2018-07-30 02:28:45	SuperLag	weq: I will have to check it out, in any case. Thank you for the recommendation.

2018-07-30 14:59:41	TheBard	Why ask us?  Ask them.  But why would they?  Just so people can work exploits on ancient systems?
2018-07-30 15:00:10	Danoded	I mean, they open sourced .NET
2018-07-30 15:00:22	Danoded	And open sourcing older win versions would be astronomically huge
2018-07-30 15:00:40	TheBard	think of the liability.
2018-07-30 15:00:44	Danoded	As well as people creating forks off of Windows XP and 7 to develop
2018-07-30 15:01:09	Danoded	Liability
2018-07-30 15:01:56	GraysonBriggs	Danoded you'd use a fork of XP for your main OS?

2018-07-30 15:02:57	Danoded	GraysonBriggs: Personally, I'd would be a mix up between Vista and 7, XP, maybe. Guess that's enough deviation from me, just a thought
2018-07-30 15:03:24	Danoded	TheBard: Yeah that's what they want
2018-07-30 15:03:27	TheBard	if you start selling Freddie's Windows (based on Win7), this might cause them some problems.
2018-07-30 15:04:07	Danoded	People would try that? Huh
2018-07-30 15:06:10	GraysonBriggs	Danoded I like thinking about hypotheticals, was just wondering what your reasoning was, I use to love Win7 but now Windows 10 is good and I can't imagine Windows loosing out on sales because you could go back and use a free version of Win7
2018-07-30 15:06:15	Danoded	Guess ReactOS is as close as we'll get
2018-07-30 15:06:36	TheBard	or just use Windows 10
2018-07-30 15:07:55	Danoded	GraysonBriggs: I thought it would be pretty cool to be able to have different "flavors" of Windows. I'm using 10 now but 7 is still my main system. What's better is that a person/team out there would definitely keep older versions of Windows alive if it was open-sourced, but as you said, MS doesn't want people on old Win versions and losing out on
2018-07-30 15:07:55	Danoded	sales
2018-07-30 15:08:37	TheBard	No, those old versions are unsupported, and no longer secure or safe to use.

2018-07-30 17:58:56	ovkmwe	I have no idea how the winRE ended up overlapping
2018-07-30 17:59:03	Stryyker	but ultimately if you're using *parted, clonezilla etc. it isn't a Windows issue and isn't for here
2018-07-30 17:59:34	ovkmwe	fair enough
2018-07-30 18:00:11	ovkmwe	I thought I was asking about the MBR itself but I guess it came to gparted and the like
2018-07-30 18:00:20	catpig	one last idea though: delete the MBR and create a new one with the correct values. be certain to get the start/end, type, and any flags (like boot) right. set the labels the same, too, just in case
2018-07-30 18:01:09	catpig	in particular, make sure you set the values in terms of sectors, not MB. you don't wanna have rounding errors in this
2018-07-30 18:01:33	ovkmwe	I was planning on editing the MBR, how would I create a new one?
2018-07-30 18:02:03	catpig	if you delete it and then start linux fdisk i think it asks you if you want to create a new one

2018-07-30 18:59:11	FXpro	like I said, web logs into my existing account fine, windows 7 logs in fine and its updated to the latest, I just tried to install skype and log in to my existing account and it wants me to sign up and gives no option to sign into an existing account.
2018-07-30 18:59:15	system16	is there a command / app to see the smart status of my drive ? its an external hard drive. and my bios wont show it to me

2018-07-30 19:00:13	naphtali	system16, some 3rd party applications can pull that data. It's not built into the Windows OS
2018-07-30 19:00:19	system16	oh ok
2018-07-30 19:01:09	naphtali	The guys in ##hardware would probably have a better idea on the best applications for that

2018-07-30 19:14:55	NanoSector	hi, i'm trying to update a tablet using the Update Assistant from version 1607 to 1803
2018-07-30 19:15:18	NanoSector	but it's taking a very, VERY long time, it's been doing the initial phase since 10pm and it's 2am now and it's at 97%
2018-07-30 19:15:28	NanoSector	is there a way to speed it up?
2018-07-30 19:15:33	NanoSector	or is there a faster way to do it
2018-07-30 19:15:45	naphtali	What kind of tablet is it?

2018-07-30 19:16:14	NanoSector	a Cube Iwork 10 with an Atom x5-Z8350, 4GB RAM and 64GB eMMC
2018-07-30 19:16:29	NanoSector	and I realize the CPU isn't the fastest but it shouldn't be taking *this* long
2018-07-30 19:17:12	NanoSector	it was relatively speedy until like 95%
2018-07-30 19:17:20	NanoSector	now it's only progressing 1% per hour or so
2018-07-30 19:17:50	catpig	i'd leave it for the night and hope it's done tomorrow morning
2018-07-30 19:18:32	naphtali	Given those specs, I would also recommend you let it run
2018-07-30 19:18:33	NanoSector	does it automatically go to upgrading?
2018-07-30 19:19:26	NanoSector	i wouldn't want to wake up this morning seeing "we're ready for the upgrade, press restart to continue"
2018-07-30 19:21:21	catpig	are you still in normal windows, or is it just updating and you cant do anything?
2018-07-30 19:21:22	naphtali	You are on this screen? https://mk0intowindows84fvao.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Windows-10-Update-Assistant-pic6.png
2018-07-30 19:21:28	NanoSector	catpig, normal windows
2018-07-30 19:21:35	NanoSector	naphtali, yes
2018-07-30 19:21:46	naphtali	That's the last step before the reboot
2018-07-30 19:21:57	NanoSector	sure, but will it automatically reboot
2018-07-30 19:22:01	naphtali	No
2018-07-30 19:22:13	naphtali	well yes, in 30 mins I think
2018-07-30 19:22:35	NanoSector	i'll sit it out until 3:30am and if it hasn't done anything by then, yolo
2018-07-30 19:22:39	catpig	i'd argue thats worth it. go to sleep, it should be done tomorrow ;)
2018-07-30 19:23:05	NanoSector	i'd argue a reinstall would've been faster
2018-07-30 19:23:20	catpig	probably. too late now though
2018-07-30 19:23:21	NanoSector	even with the odd hardware that's inside of this
2018-07-30 19:23:33	catpig	at this point aborting and starting a reinstall would be slower, i suspect
2018-07-30 19:23:41	naphtali	Anything eMMC is a dog slow
2018-07-30 19:23:46	naphtali	err dog slow
2018-07-30 19:24:17	NanoSector	well windows isn't helping itself either
2018-07-30 19:24:40	naphtali	How so?
2018-07-30 19:24:55	NanoSector	all sorts of background stuff eating away the already limited resources
2018-07-30 19:25:11	catpig	lets not go down that route ;)
2018-07-30 19:25:31	naphtali	People ask for a cheap tablet with Windows, that is one of them
2018-07-30 19:25:38	NanoSector	search was indexing the files the update assistant/dism was creating, windows update was installing updates in the background (just...don't, it's all going to be replaced anyway) and Defender was eating half of my CPU
2018-07-30 19:26:03	D-rex	any ideas what would cause system icons to not appear on taskbar?  The settings icon, security center, etc... all of the white outline icons are not appearing on the taskbar it's just blank

2018-07-31 04:48:15	weq	Rashad: no.
2018-07-31 04:48:21	weq	wsx: try asking the android community.
2018-07-31 04:48:49	Rashad	wsx: Your android device needs to have MiraCast capability.
2018-07-31 04:48:52	wsx	i did that's a windows app tho
2018-07-31 04:49:04	wsx	all android above 4.2 are supposed to have miracast
2018-07-31 04:49:13	wsx	so pretty much all android today
2018-07-31 04:49:15	Rashad	Nope.
2018-07-31 04:49:18	wsx	yup
2018-07-31 04:49:25	Rashad	I thought so too, wsx.
2018-07-31 04:49:33	Rashad	Let me check.
2018-07-31 04:50:16	weq	if your device supports miracast you just need to configure "projecting to this pc"
2018-07-31 04:51:04	weq	but your windows computer needs to be on wireless if your android device is also
2018-07-31 04:51:26	wsx	blah blah i know i even made a thread about it
2018-07-31 04:51:28	wsx	http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/id-3755341/casting-android-windows.html
2018-07-31 04:51:59	Rashad	wsx: First paragraph: https://www.phonerated.com/miracast_smartphones-listbycat
2018-07-31 04:52:12	weq	no need to act like a douche just because of it though. I can't know what you already know or not.
2018-07-31 04:52:31	wsx	i'm not into buying smart phones
2018-07-31 04:52:37	wsx	ok but i asked if you have used it
2018-07-31 04:54:24	weq	and I asked you to try asking an android community. We know that Windows supports miracast by default. If that is not good enough then you ought to seek out them for alternatives. This channel is about Windows not android.
2018-07-31 04:54:54	wsx	are you telling me that's not microsoft's fault that i cannot connect ?
2018-07-31 04:55:14	wsx	tell that to microsoft fan boys not me
2018-07-31 04:55:15	weq	I never said that. I say that we support Windows here. Not your android issue.

2018-07-31 06:50:47	ankk	hi
2018-07-31 06:51:02	ankk	I have some weird problem on my operating system(windows 10)
2018-07-31 06:51:27	TheBard	Like what.
2018-07-31 06:51:58	ankk	https://justpaste.it/5qguj
2018-07-31 06:52:15	ankk	this is the error message I got when I try to run a InstallShield setup.exe
2018-07-31 06:52:38	ankk	this same setup was running on the same system before.. there wasn't any problem...
2018-07-31 06:53:29	ankk	but somehow I forgot a process open and I had some memory warning about operating system and It warned  me to close applications etc..
2018-07-31 06:53:49	ankk	after that memory problem, I started to get this error message on a few apps..
2018-07-31 06:54:05	ankk	one of them was microsoft office. I uninstalled office and installed again, problem solved
2018-07-31 06:54:20	ankk	but this is InstallShield and it is in C:\Windows\SysWOW64\InstallShield folder
2018-07-31 06:54:33	ankk	so it is secured and I can't change anything re-install etc..
2018-07-31 06:54:56	ankk	I tried sfc /scannow but it didn't find anything
2018-07-31 06:55:19	ankk	how can i repair only InstallShield part of system?
2018-07-31 07:01:29	weq	ehm what setup is this?
2018-07-31 07:01:48	weq	Office installer doesn't use Installshield setups.
2018-07-31 07:01:49	ankk	driver setup
2018-07-31 07:02:01	TheBard	If you think you damaged Windows, you can try loading your last Restore Point, which might put you back into a stable condition before installing?
2018-07-31 07:02:08	ankk	InstallShield is not the main problem
2018-07-31 07:02:24	ankk	I think InstallShield effected from the memory problem
2018-07-31 07:02:41	ankk	TheBard: I had not restore point before the problem :(

2018-07-31 19:15:50	praet	Hello all, I'm looking for options to wirelessly cast Win10 machines to a 1440p monitor.
2018-07-31 19:16:12	jcotton	Windows 8 and up natively support miracast
2018-07-31 19:16:15	NanoSector	a miracast receiver is likely your best bet
2018-07-31 19:16:18	jcotton	And windows 10 can be a miracast target
2018-07-31 19:16:24	jcotton	Or you can use a miracast reciever
2018-07-31 19:16:39	NanoSector	i've always found the miracast support in windows to be very buggy
2018-07-31 19:16:40	praet	Are there any miracast recievers that support 1440p though?
2018-07-31 19:17:02	jcotton	Probably
2018-07-31 19:17:05	praet	I was thinking Roku as an option but its limited to 1080p
2018-07-31 19:17:10	jcotton	Amazon is your friend
2018-07-31 19:17:11	NanoSector	praet, maybe look into a cheap NUC or something that you can place behind the monitor
2018-07-31 19:17:14	praet	But I dont need audio
2018-07-31 19:17:22	NanoSector	i think modern Celerons support 1440p and even 4k
2018-07-31 19:17:45	praet	Like an intel compute stick?
2018-07-31 19:17:52	NanoSector	not sure if that'd be powerful enough
2018-07-31 19:17:57	NanoSector	but something like that
2018-07-31 19:18:07	NanoSector	added benefit of being able to use it as standalone computer
2018-07-31 19:18:13	praet	what about an rPi
2018-07-31 19:18:17	NanoSector	hmm
2018-07-31 19:18:25	compdoc	I use chromecast. works with any OS with a Chrome browser and wifi. dunno chromecast specs, but I cast to large samsung tv and it looks great from the couch
2018-07-31 19:19:56	praet	Looks like even Chromecast Ultra will drop to 1080p if 4k is not supported
2018-07-31 19:20:16	NanoSector	looking at https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/video.md it doesn't look like 1440p is supported
2018-07-31 19:20:18	praet	if its not a common TV stream then these devices wont support it
2018-07-31 19:20:23	NanoSector	oh, it is
2018-07-31 19:20:27	NanoSector	1920x1440
2018-07-31 19:20:40	NanoSector	but that's more square

2018-07-31 19:21:03	NanoSector	you can define a custom mode
2018-07-31 19:22:20	praet	hmm i can try it with a pi3 here
2018-07-31 19:23:13	praet	its strange that there isnt anything out there though. even if you had to go for a more expensive 4k version
2018-07-31 19:23:36	jcotton	I mean, that's a lot of data to push without a cable
2018-07-31 19:24:13	praet	miracast looks interesting
2018-07-31 19:24:36	praet	4k is even more data :)
2018-07-31 19:24:58	praet	agreed though, connecting to 4k laptops remotely was brutal

2018-07-31 21:52:49	k810	have a dilemma. have an hp x2 10.1 tablet laptop with an intel atom x8350 and 4gb memory with 64gb emmc... came preinstalled with windows 10 oem.. i used msmg and trimmed down windows 10 installation with a reimage of the drive and new installation of that win10 to make it run more efficient.. disabled tons of stuff and removed tons of stuff.. runs ok but still a little lag especially with edge and youtube..
2018-07-31 21:53:07	k810	put win81 on it and it flies but there doesnt appear to be drivers for 8 or 7 for the intel atom x8350
2018-07-31 21:53:12	k810	not sure what to do
2018-07-31 21:53:14	k810	win10 lean isnt out
2018-07-31 21:53:20	k810	i trimmed down win10 a lot
2018-07-31 21:53:33	k810	even unparked cpu cores
2018-07-31 21:53:38	k810	while plugged in
2018-07-31 21:53:57	k810	its responsive but its not fast and when you load edge and hit up youtube and type into the search field the keystrokes actually lag
2018-07-31 21:54:02	k810	though chrome doesnt really do that
2018-07-31 21:54:09	k810	but you can tell its not very snappy compared to 8.1 and 7
2018-07-31 21:54:12	k810	any ideas?
2018-07-31 21:54:30	k810	ive already done the works.. disabled transparency, disabled all unneeded features, removed telemetry, removed integrated apps
2018-07-31 21:54:30	k810	etc
2018-07-31 21:54:40	k810	all drivers were installed correctly

2018-08-01 02:51:54	weq	You need a proper networking protocol for that. Which requires special equipment. There is nothing in Windows that supports this.
2018-08-01 02:52:54	silv3r_m00n	is there no way to even do it manually ?
2018-08-01 02:53:09	silv3r_m00n	like going to network settings everytime there is a disconnection and enabling a second connection
2018-08-01 02:53:21	weq	there will still be disruption.
2018-08-01 02:53:46	silv3r_m00n	disruption is fine, for about 15 seconds or so, i can quickly manually change

2018-08-01 02:55:30	weq	and then you need manually change the gateway if one falls down.

2018-08-01 02:55:56	silv3r_m00n	i went to ipv4 settings, i can either do ip automatically or specify manually

2018-08-01 02:57:06	weq	but you can only have 1 gateway
2018-08-01 02:57:16	weq	that is what you need to manually change WHEN the connection goes down.
2018-08-01 02:57:17	silv3r_m00n	right, thats the issue, i need 2 gateways
2018-08-01 02:57:23	weq	There is no such thing.
2018-08-01 02:57:31	weq	You need specialist equipment for such.
2018-08-01 02:57:41	silv3r_m00n	on ubuntu i create like 2 connection profiles, disable 1st one and enable 2nd one
2018-08-01 02:58:05	weq	Nothing like that in Windows. You could ofc script it to make it similar.
2018-08-01 02:58:05	silv3r_m00n	and then the network manager quickly changes the ip of the nic from 192.168.1.207 to 192.168.2.207 to connect via gateway2

2018-08-01 05:39:18	arcanescu	still the utilities should behave consistently
2018-08-01 05:39:30	weq	take that up with MS, nothing we really can do about it.
2018-08-01 05:39:30	arcanescu	CIM?
2018-08-01 05:39:41	weq	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Information_Model_(computing)
2018-08-01 05:40:44	weq	you can query the different APIs in Windows that is typically used by tools like msinfo32 through CIM and get the exact same information. You just need to know which classes to query.

2018-08-01 23:33:55	zyme	stevendale: I highly recommend that you put a page file on a SSD and not a HDD whenever possible, as almost all running processes read and write to the page file regardless of if you have enough ram to skip using a paging file completely - it's dumb but most programs are designed to use it and will crash or fail to run without it.
2018-08-01 23:35:24	zyme	it's one of the major choke points for most all computers lagging performance issues..
2018-08-01 23:37:38	zyme	Years ago, about 10 maybe a little more, I bought a physical ram-drive that used ddr and had a battery to hold the data during power outages. It was 4GB but back then that was plenty big enough - and it's entire purpose was the paging file.

2018-08-02 06:36:10	Stryyker	you could create issues that deleting partition 4 makes the loader not see the other partition as the same (it could become to be seen as partition 5)

2018-08-02 20:59:34	guideX	CptLuxx, part of the problem was, my vm was not generation 2, and the iso I was using doesn't work with generation 2 (which was why I opted for generation 1), yet my vhdx has gpt drives, the way to do it is https://pastebin.com/raw/43C7FcXM
2018-08-02 21:05:34	jcotton	guideX: aren't you doing a server 2003 vm?
2018-08-02 21:06:53	guideX	jcotton, this is a win10 machine (different hyperv project with different problem)
2018-08-02 21:06:58	guideX	actually my server 2003 worked out
2018-08-02 21:06:59	jcotton	ah
2018-08-02 21:07:07	jcotton	the ISO should work with gen 2 tho
2018-08-02 21:07:21	jcotton	unless you did something weird
2018-08-02 21:07:22	guideX	I learned: the iso I was using was generated with imgburn, so it won't work that way
2018-08-02 21:07:35	guideX	I created it from the windows cd, I guess hyperv doesn't like that when doing gen2
2018-08-02 21:07:53	guideX	so you must use the media creation tool to get a legit iso
2018-08-02 21:08:10	guideX	I mean, the iso worked and stuff, but not with gen 2 heh
2018-08-02 21:08:40	guideX	so then, after using gen1, I'm stuck with gpt, and can't make partitions active etc
2018-08-02 21:08:56	jcotton	widnwos won't boot from gpt on bios tho
2018-08-02 21:09:01	jcotton	and gen1 is bios

2018-08-02 22:56:36	Ham62	I'm setting up a laptop for my friend's friend and it has an issue of overheating a lot so I put speedFan on his computer so he can monitor the temps in the tray
2018-08-02 22:56:44	Ham62	but I can't figure out how to make it automatically start with the system
2018-08-02 22:56:55	Ham62	because it requires admin to control the fans and stuff
2018-08-02 22:57:29	Ham62	so putting it in the startup folder doesn't do anything and putting it in the task scheduler on logon just dims the desktop with a UAC popup whenever he logs in
2018-08-02 22:57:39	Ham62	how can I fix it so it just runs without the stupud UAC thing?
2018-08-02 22:57:47	Ham62	should I just disable the UAC on the laptop?
2018-08-02 22:58:03	Ham62	I've never had these issues on my desktop because I just don't have UAC on it
2018-08-02 22:58:07	Ham62	I forgot how annoying it is

2018-08-02 23:30:26	Ham62	I opened it up because I had to fix the power button and I cleared all the dust from the fan and stuff
2018-08-02 23:30:37	Ham62	but it doesn't seem to have helped that much
2018-08-02 23:31:12	Ham62	it might be thermal paste but I would literally need to remove the motherboard from the chassis and flip it over to get to the heatsink directly
2018-08-02 23:31:31	Ham62	so I don't want to attempt that and break something

2018-08-03 01:49:33	weq	ziggylazer: bootable usb is simple enough, but what is supposed to be booted here? that is a relevant question.
2018-08-03 01:50:02	ziggylazer	parrot
2018-08-03 01:50:09	weq	cause you can do everything in diskpart if you wanted to basically but it is typically easier to use tools
2018-08-03 01:50:24	Tools	No, don't use me D:
2018-08-03 01:50:41	weq	Rufus is probably your easiest solution then.
2018-08-03 01:50:48	Tools	I was about to suggest Rufus too
2018-08-03 01:51:04	Tools	That's pretty much my go-to-tool when flashing ISOs to USBs
2018-08-03 01:51:25	ziggylazer	Do you have any explanation to why it would deny me access ?
2018-08-03 01:52:36	ziggylazer	if I run cmd under admin priv. Those rights are inherent of all I do in that session?
2018-08-03 01:52:36	weq	the error message are typically never wrong, so it could be either a bad block device or permissions depending on the filesystem. Sorta hard to look into the crystal ball without any details.
2018-08-03 01:52:54	Tools	Also, 'under' admin or 'as' admin?
2018-08-03 01:53:08	ziggylazer	run as admin
2018-08-03 01:53:24	Tools	Alright :p
2018-08-03 01:53:33	ziggylazer	weq, thanks, I'll use a tool

My latest nvidia driver graphics card update went wrong ( 398.82). i had to fallback to previous version ( 398.36 ) which is working fine. my question is . bypassing this current version 398.82 on nvidia experience , will i see the following update ? or i need to install versions in a sequenced way in order to see the next update ?

2018-08-03 09:11:38	Ulrar	I'm asking if the windows iso are hybrids or not
2018-08-03 09:13:51	TheBard	would a bit by bit copy work.  Define 'work'.
2018-08-03 09:14:59	Ulrar	If they are hybrid, then just `dd if=windows.iso of=/dev/sdb` would work. If they aren't I need to get unetbootin or something like that to make it
2018-08-03 09:15:09	Ulrar	work would be boot

2018-08-03 23:09:38	jcotton	Unblock-File in PowerShell
2018-08-03 23:09:56	jcotton	requires PSv3 or later (bundled with win8+, installable on 7)
2018-08-03 23:11:21	jcotton	you can do Unblock-File * to

2018-08-03 23:11:33	jcotton	the latter does it recursively

2018-08-06 02:21:42	ThomasB	Hello. I have a Surface Pro 4 and I guess my secure boot keys got fucked up somehow. On Surface Pro 3 this fix is as easy as going into the UEFI and resetting to the default keys, but there's no such option on the SP4 UEFI. I previously disabled secure boot to dual boot Arch. I've since deleted that partition. Every time I try to enable Secure Boot it returns "The system failed to update the Secure Boot certificate keyset." Does anyone have
2018-08-06 02:21:42	ThomasB	any clue on how I can go about resetting this? I have re-installed Windows and re-installed the SP4 firmware already.

2018-08-06 06:20:51	zack6849	Aoyagi_raventop: that spacing looks normal to me, but you can change your icon size and stuff to make sure to align them to grid and sort by something so windows doesn't forget them
2018-08-06 06:21:01	zack6849	not sure why it'd be forgetting them in the first place though
2018-08-06 06:21:39	Aoyagi_raventop	No I  really do not want Window's sorting.
2018-08-06 06:21:45	Aoyagi_raventop	Windows'
2018-08-06 06:22:58	Aoyagi_raventop	This is normal spacing, and what I had yesterday. I don't think it's related to icon size.

2018-08-06 20:58:42	tsarompy	has anyone seen this before? i cant find any info online about it, hence im asking here
2018-08-06 20:58:56	Stryyker	Caelum: are you running it as admin?
2018-08-06 20:59:26	Stryyker	tsarompy: have you made any Windows modifications? When did the issue start? What changes were made about that time?
2018-08-06 20:59:54	Caelum	Stryyker: yeah, the server feature was hidden, I'm trying the github build now
2018-08-06 21:00:23	tsarompy	Stryyker: its a pretty vanilla 8.1 install. updates are current, only real modification was installing classic menu/shell
2018-08-06 21:00:28	tsarompy	it happens on a few programs, not just chromium
2018-08-06 21:00:45	Stryyker	maybe it is classic menu/shell
2018-08-06 21:00:56	tsarompy	as far as when it started, no idea. i installed chromium about an hour ago but ive seen this issue before
2018-08-06 21:01:05	tsarompy	but it only affects certain programs. firefox, for instance, looks fine
2018-08-06 21:01:32	Stryyker	Any MS programs?
2018-08-06 21:01:47	drakonan	Maarten: yeah i click it and nothing... but out of complete craziness all of a sudden its working for the first time in two days
2018-08-06 21:02:09	tsarompy	nah, ms programs are fine
2018-08-06 21:02:24	tsarompy	im still googling the problem. i guess it isnt super common
2018-08-06 21:02:45	tsarompy	specifically, messengerfordesktop, opera, chromium, google chrome canary, all have this issue

2018-08-06 21:03:33	Stryyker	Does messengerfordesktop use any library from Google or Chromium? Could be a common thing
2018-08-06 21:04:23	tsarompy	hm i dunno
2018-08-06 21:04:40	tsarompy	im pretty sure its just a wrapper for messenger.com
2018-08-06 21:04:50	Stryyker	Opera is built on Chromium base
2018-08-06 21:04:52	tsarompy	yz
2018-08-06 21:05:03	tsarompy	i dunno, would blink affect the system font though?
2018-08-06 21:05:14	Stryyker	I know nothing about blink
2018-08-06 21:05:15	tsarompy	its in the tab title, the url bar, even the right click menu
2018-08-06 21:05:18	tsarompy	yea me neither
2018-08-06 21:06:16	tsarompy	a friend recommended i try ccleaner
2018-08-06 21:06:23	tsarompy	something about font caching

2018-08-06 21:08:36	jcotton	Some of its options can break things

2018-08-06 21:09:17	tsarompy	im just using it to scan
2018-08-06 21:09:22	Stryyker	Avast pulled a recent version too
2018-08-06 21:10:08	tsarompy	wasnt ccleaner the program that was phoning home about users files
2018-08-06 21:10:14	tsarompy	like a week or two ago
2018-08-06 21:10:22	Stryyker	no idea but the issue was relating to privacy
2018-08-06 21:10:30	jcotton	Also it was really hard to quit iirc
2018-08-06 21:10:49	tsarompy	ahh
2018-08-06 21:10:51	Stryyker	My only guess is Chromium etc. wants to use a font you don't have.

2018-08-06 21:48:37	donavan01	I was givent a laptop from the place I work that was "broken" turned out to just be a bad power button ... the customer who dropped it off abandoned it about a year ago and no one has been able to get ahold of them ... its currently got windows 8.1 installed on in it and I dont really want to wipe the system clean and reinstall the OS because I dont know the windows key and I cant get the
2018-08-06 21:48:38	donavan01	recovery partition to work... I know in some versions of windows server there was a way to crack the admin password but is there anything like this for windows 8.1  I want to do a system refresh but apparently I cant do much unless I can acutally get into windows ... suggestions aside from blowing everything away and using a reinstall

2018-08-06 21:51:55	sourcream	@jcotton, you there?
2018-08-06 21:52:07	donavan01	also what is the version of windows 10 that is free.... I forget what the program name is I know I have it on one of my laptops but I cannot for the life of me remember what it was called ... initially I got it as a beta and then enrolled in the program and got free upgrades
2018-08-06 21:52:44	Kadigan	donavan01: the free Windows 10 rollout ended over a year ago. I'm not sure if it 'remembers' that you were in it, though.
2018-08-06 21:52:55	donavan01	it basically forces you to do all MS updates and such and gathers some info in exchange for a free copy
2018-08-06 21:53:05	Kadigan	If this is a PC that never took this opportunity, you're out of luck.
2018-08-06 21:53:22	donavan01	yeah I know that I just cant remember what it was called
2018-08-06 21:53:42	donavan01	and im not talking about the free upgrade to windows 10 from 7 or 8
2018-08-06 21:54:03	Kadigan	Throughout the duration of that period, you'd have an upgrade assistant installed... but that's not a separate piece of software.
2018-08-06 21:55:17	Kadigan	As for breaking admin passwords - we don't do that here. There's no way we can reliably determine if you're a legitimate owner of that hardware or not, so we just don't.
2018-08-06 21:55:45	donavan01	no its not the upgrade program ... I know that ended but I got signed up for some program through ms and I have used it to install at least 3 different copies of windows 10 on machines and got legal legit keys from MS for nothing and it wasnt as an upgrade it was just some program ... I want to say it was windows insider program but dont remember
2018-08-06 21:56:17	donavan01	kadigan ... fair enough on the password and I thought of that after I posted it
2018-08-06 21:58:59	donavan01	any suggestions on how to get a dell inspiron 5755 to do recovery then ... I have googled but it tells me to press f8 on boot but nothing happens ... I think that predates windows 8 and used to work on older machines ... I have even put a boot disc in the usb and it doesnt recognize it ... is that because it using efi and is locked down ?

2018-08-06 22:18:20	natesreich	Hello, I have a Windows Feature 1803 update pending. Last time Windows tried to install, it got stuck in a reboot loop and I basically had to reinstall Windows and all of my applications.
2018-08-06 22:18:32	natesreich	I had set my connection to metered, yet Windows somehow managed to download the updates.
2018-08-06 22:18:42	natesreich	How can I prevent the pending Windows update from executing?
2018-08-06 22:19:01	natesreich	I have ran: net stop wuauserv
2018-08-06 22:19:41	natesreich	I also deleted the SoftwareDistribution folder
2018-08-06 22:19:53	natesreich	Yet, it's still asking me to reboot to install the update.

2018-08-06 22:59:29	catpig	natesreich, permanently preventing it is really not a good idea because they stop security support as well. why didnt you just install the new version when you had to reinstall?
2018-08-06 23:01:23	catpig	if i understand wiki correctly then 1709 gets support until april 2019. check the windows update settings, there should be a setting there to delay feature updates

2018-08-06 23:04:53	natesreich	catpig: My Internet is extremely slow. The Windows Media Tool Kit alone took forever to download.
2018-08-06 23:05:13	natesreich	I couldn't go through installing the 4GB Windows update again.
2018-08-06 23:05:41	catpig	natesreich, not here to tell you what to do, just saying, delaying is only viable short-term. it's up to you to apply that to your specific circumstances :)
2018-08-06 23:05:41	natesreich	Worth noting, I am in a hotel the past month or so (recently relocated), hence the slow connection.
2018-08-06 23:06:15	catpig	if you cant download it you cant download it. and as noted, aiui there's 6 months of security patches left
2018-08-06 23:06:29	natesreich	So, Windows decided to perform the update and trap my PC into a reboot loop while I was in a new Caribbean country, staying in a hotel. :D
2018-08-06 23:06:51	catpig	windows update can be quite joyful at times ;)
2018-08-06 23:07:00	natesreich	Haha tell me about it.

2018-08-07 05:40:52	Stryyker	aruns: you said as non-admin
2018-08-07 05:41:00	Tencryn	weq: I am following that! i repeat, the BSODs are related to a system file (albeit, i've read that it doesn't necessarily mean the file is corrupt). drivers are updated. I haven't used driver verifier tool yet, I'm actually scared to now. I did use sfc, but it caused a different BSOD. no new hardware added. memory check returns fine.
2018-08-07 05:41:02	aruns	No, I said as admin.

2018-08-07 05:41:42	aruns	No worries.
2018-08-07 05:42:00	aruns	Is it maybe compatibility issues because Command Prompt doesn't include an SSH server by default? Stryyker
2018-08-07 05:42:11	aruns	I am using OpenSSH through Vagrant.
2018-08-07 05:42:19	Tencryn	Stryyker do I really have to? if it renders my PC unbootable... well, is it just a case of reinstalling windows or is it worse than that?

2018-08-07 05:46:07	Stryyker	Tencryn: So to be clear the page has things to look at BEFORE you try Driver Verifier.

2018-08-07 06:44:14	Tencryn	To an extent, yes. Originally before any issues started, I had a 1TB HDD and a 250GB SSD. The SSD is under C and has not been touched since it was added when building the PC. My HDD was set to D. It wasn't touched since the building of my PC. Unfortunately, this drive died... it couldn't be recognised. I replaced it with a 160GB HDD. After a powercut, the bad config info issues started happening.
2018-08-07 06:44:32	Tencryn	There shouldn't be any 3rd party security software. I've only ever relied on Windows Defender.

2018-08-08 05:21:37	weq	theming for "giggles" is not something Microsoft has really bothered to invest a lot of time and resources to. That is why companies like Stardock exists etc. Though those solutions are not supported here etc. Nor does Microsoft, when patching dlls like that they are not liable for any damages to your device etc.
2018-08-08 05:21:48	Aoyagi_raventop	...
2018-08-08 05:21:52	Aoyagi_raventop	For giggles?
2018-08-08 05:22:55	CptLuxx	its a term from family guy
2018-08-08 05:23:23	weq	as it is purely cosmetical and subjective I consider it in the giggles department. Windows has never been designed in that manner nor doubtful that Microsoft will shift it's focus towards that. You just gotta take it for what it is.
2018-08-08 05:23:27	Aoyagi_raventop	I don't see how that makes it any less demeaning.
2018-08-08 05:24:43	weq	and that is your opinion. So for the features you want you should consider looking into 3rd parties like stardock or perhaps there is a movement on the feedback hub regarding this. It is basically a non-issue.

2018-08-09 00:13:31	Smeef	Is there a more appropriate sub than this one for asking about Microsoft Surface support? My ~4 year old Pro 3 battery has started bulging and lifting the screen off of the device, Microsoft claims that they are going to replace it for free with a Pro 4 once I ship the damaged device back to them, but I've read articles and posts where people claim to have sent their devices in and never gotten the replacement, I'm wondering if anyone here has had
2018-08-09 00:13:32	Smeef	a positive experience with a similar situation.

2018-08-09 00:19:36	Smeef	I also had to send them photos of the bulging, so they should be aware of the condition, all these articles I'm reading has me a bit anxious I suppose, my SP3 is my main workhorse, feel like my life is temporarily shut down without it
2018-08-09 00:21:17	Smeef	Anyway, it's an open question, if anyone reads it and can confirm or refute the reports, I'd be interested to hear it

2018-08-09 00:45:55	Stryyker	What it effectively does is move your OS aside, install a new Windows version and import data.
2018-08-09 00:46:20	Stryyker	It should have already been all downloaded and doing the install.
2018-08-09 00:46:20	flashpoint	so it's not going to happen any time soon then
2018-08-09 00:46:59	flashpoint	the install has been stuck on 89% for a LONG time

2018-08-09 00:47:10	flashpoint	whatever that metric is supposed to represent
2018-08-09 00:47:18	Stryyker	some parts can be slow, especially if you're using a HDD
2018-08-09 00:47:47	Stryyker	also can depend on disk speed, fragmentation, AV installed, how much you have installed

2018-08-09 00:48:21	Stryyker	Resource Monitor (not Task Manager) can be helpful. No idea if it is CPU issue or disk issue.
2018-08-09 00:48:35	flashpoint	it'll be these horribly slow drives
2018-08-09 00:48:49	Stryyker	the disk tab of it can be a clue - disk queue size, response times
2018-08-09 00:48:56	flashpoint	I was thinking about removing the wifi and putting an msata drive there
2018-08-09 00:49:15	flashpoint	I'll just leave it, it's not going to go any faster with me pissing about
2018-08-09 00:50:03	Stryyker	if it has issues after the reboot, it could be related to security software or drivers - especially older GPU drivers

2018-08-09 01:48:21	beepnboop-	you think i didn't try?
2018-08-09 01:48:40	weq	Though we don't typically recommend installating windows 7 anymore even though it is still supported.

2018-08-09 01:48:52	Stryyker	Did you find a Windows 7 slipstreaming guide?
2018-08-09 01:49:11	weq	win7 will be unsupported rather soon
2018-08-09 01:49:30	beepnboop-	its not main os

2018-08-09 01:50:59	nate	(assuming they aren't already in, and that you already checked your UEFI/BIOS interface for such a setting)

2018-08-09 01:51:45	nate	past that slipstreaming is really your only option, there's no magic way to get Windows 7 natively to identify a chipset it has no drivers for outside of including those drivers yourself (slipstream) or hardware workarounds (UEFI/BIOS toggles)
2018-08-09 01:51:46	weq	http://codeabitwiser.com/2014/03/how-to-install-windows-7-with-only-usb-3-0-ports/ <- that is the basic process. easy enough if you have the correct drivers.
2018-08-09 01:52:00	beepnboop-	i managed to get keyboard and mouse to work in the installation which are connected to usb3(needed to use ps/2 in order to do so) but for some reason it didn't affect usb stick
2018-08-09 01:52:03	beepnboop-	i don't get it
2018-08-09 01:52:10	beepnboop-	makes 0 sense
2018-08-09 01:52:32	Stryyker	you may need to do similar for sata3 too
2018-08-09 01:52:47	beepnboop-	whats slipstreaming
2018-08-09 01:53:12	nate	Stryyker: That should be okay as long as it's at least SP1
2018-08-09 01:53:23	beepnboop-	i tried every sata conntroler driver there was in the chipset pack i got from amd website
2018-08-09 01:53:25	nate	(same with SSDs)
2018-08-09 01:55:22	Stryyker	slipstreaming is integrating drivers to the install media in a suitable way
2018-08-09 01:55:27	weq	you spent 11 hours at guides and haven't understood the concept of what you are trying to do? Slipstreaming is the concept of what the guide I just linked to is about. Though in other settings it means something else.
2018-08-09 01:55:59	beepnboop-	i knpw i have the right drivers i installed the driver in my old pc's os and it worked perfectly fine
2018-08-09 01:56:22	beepnboop-	not 11 hours
2018-08-09 01:56:32	beepnboop-	i built the pc first

2018-08-09 01:56:35	weq	7 sorry.
2018-08-09 01:56:49	beepnboop-	its upgrade of mb cpu ram cp cooler
2018-08-09 01:57:09	nate	beepnboop-: Your old PC is completely irrelevant to this question I think as your issue has already been answered.  You stated your system has no USB2 ports.  Windows 7 does not have native drivers for USB3 chipset, meaning you need to slipstream or look for hardware updates at the UEFI/BIOS level
2018-08-09 01:57:14	nate	Did someone else install your windows previously?
2018-08-09 01:57:28	nate	Actually ignore that, just realized you said you replaced the mobo too
2018-08-09 01:57:44	Stryyker	which means it may have installed a different part of the drivers
2018-08-09 01:57:55	Stryyker	and it has different hardware...
2018-08-09 01:57:57	nate	Also means his old motherboard probably has USB2 ports too :P
2018-08-09 01:58:03	nate	s/has/had
2018-08-09 01:58:05	beepnboop-	the install os i have on it atm is os off x97-4790k
2018-08-09 01:58:29	beepnboop-	before the usb driver i installed on it keyboard and mouse did not work
2018-08-09 01:58:38	beepnboop-	so thats how i know i have the right drivers
2018-08-09 01:59:07	weq	but you still might need the proper disk controller as Stryyker pointed out. It might be a plethora of drivers needed.
2018-08-09 01:59:10	Stryyker	That doesn't make sense
2018-08-09 01:59:23	nate	beepnboop-: the CPU has no relation here, USB chipset is on the motherboard
2018-08-09 01:59:32	beepnboop-	but its no ideal to have old os on new hardware hence why i tried to get fresh clean os
2018-08-09 01:59:32	Stryyker	Also Intel vs AMD
2018-08-09 01:59:45	Stryyker	which use different SATA, USB and other controllers
2018-08-09 02:00:24	nate	Ah didn't know AMD was mentioned earlier, yeah that's a big difference too (but still would have the same outcome, pretty sure AMD USB chipsets are usually on mobo not CPU)
2018-08-09 02:00:30	beepnboop-	i have all the chipset drivers of my cpu but i have no idea how to inject them into my iso
2018-08-09 02:00:35	nate	Again
2018-08-09 02:00:38	nate	CPU is irrelevant to this

2018-08-10 03:21:21	TotallyNotKim	hey can someone explain what's up with office 365? As far as I understood the web apps should offer the same functionality as offline, right? I'm on linux and the only thing I miss is Outlook, so I thought I'd give Outlook 365 a try...

2018-08-10 03:21:30	weq	dualbooting scenarios is not something we offer support for here. Moving the efi partition is completly possible, but you need to do everything manually with diskpart and bootrec, and bcdboot.
2018-08-10 03:22:11	TotallyNotKim	Am I right that I can't sync regular IMAP boxes with outlook 365 after September?

2018-08-10 03:28:41	nate	I highly doubt that, or it wasn't your main drive at the time.  The EFI partition contains the general boot critical stuff for UEFI boots
2018-08-10 03:29:01	nate	UEFI/GPT doesn't work like the old partition MBR stuff
2018-08-10 03:29:30	nate	If this is a case of wanting to clone a drive for some reason, the EFI partition should really be included in the cloning, not manipulated

2018-08-10 03:30:31	TotallyNotKim	no idea if that would work
2018-08-10 03:30:41	nate	Past that the fact that he's asking about it in here indicates he doesn't know what he'd doing.  Worse so the fact people are telling him it's fine to piss with is doubly concerning

2018-08-10 03:32:20	nate	removing it, manipulating it, changing it as primary, etc, will basically break the ability to boot the install
2018-08-10 03:33:12	weq	hence why I said you must still resolve it with bootrec and bcdboot. But there is no unsupported scenario as of how the technology works here. If he wishes to do this that is his choice.

2018-08-10 03:33:27	TotallyNotKim	"Select an UEFI file as trusted for executing" - that's what it says in my bios

2018-08-10 03:35:38	TotallyNotKim	that was reffering to "but what about that left over 100 mb of space though"
2018-08-10 03:35:57	TotallyNotKim	without regards about how he would come into that situation
2018-08-10 03:36:07	nate	Yes and had you known what the ESP was and it's intent you would have been able to answer properly about what that 100MB space probably was
2018-08-10 03:36:08	nate	:P
2018-08-10 03:36:16	weq	and to answer your earlier question, there are no plans of removing imap support in o365.
2018-08-10 03:37:10	nate	IMAP is currently considered the 'successor' to POP3 in most things so indeed that would be weird if they did

2018-08-10 03:49:24	weq	No I don't.
2018-08-10 03:49:56	rawtaz	microsoft's own info says to log into the store to switch out of S mode, so i presume that's what they want, for whatever reason. if that's true, the question becomes whether there's a way to switch out of it some other way, i guess.
2018-08-10 03:50:34	weq	We haven't really had much Windows S related matters appear here at all. It might be more in the Microsoft forums regarding the topic.
2018-08-10 03:51:11	rawtaz	right. unfortunately the chances of getting a reply with a relevant or solution-ish answer in those forums are extremely slim in my experience. so i dont think there's any relevant point in even trying, it's just a waste of time :/
2018-08-10 03:51:28	rawtaz	well, i'll leave it open in case anyone else knows, it'd be appreciated!
2018-08-10 03:51:37	weq	Then contact the offical support then, given that it should be in support.

2018-08-10 04:57:30	Mathis	so why is it always failing?

2018-08-10 05:49:11	txtechnow	either use a flash drive, or plug the computers into a switch, setup a shared folder on the host pc u want to copy files from and copy them over using the other computer
2018-08-10 05:49:27	paul424	I don't have a switch
2018-08-10 05:49:41	txtechnow	do you have a cross-over patch cable?
2018-08-10 05:49:44	paul424	flash drive that would take ages of swaping
2018-08-10 05:49:54	paul424	txtechnow, somewhere at home not here
2018-08-10 05:50:00	txtechnow	a flash drive using usb 3.0 or 3.1 would be fast
2018-08-10 05:50:14	bazhang	70gb?
2018-08-10 05:50:14	Stryyker	type in manage advanced sharing in to the start menu
2018-08-10 05:50:27	Stryyker	txtechnow: assuming the usb drive is also fast
2018-08-10 05:50:30	bazhang	that's one 64gb usb stick
2018-08-10 05:50:36	txtechnow	well you can still create a shared folder and copy it over using wifi
2018-08-10 05:50:45	txtechnow	Stryyker i'm assuming this guy isnt using hardware from 2005
2018-08-10 05:51:20	Stryyker	I'm guessing you haven't look at real world tests of many usb drives, even current models
2018-08-10 05:51:47	txtechnow	actually i have, hence im very picky about the flash drives i buy

2018-08-10 08:38:30	RedOrangeZ	hahaha
2018-08-10 08:38:54	TheBard	I'm serious. It sounds like Chrome application issue, rather than an OS issue.
2018-08-10 08:39:19	onlygod	TheBard: indeed, mobile hotspot made wifi connection , but devices can't connect ..
2018-08-10 08:39:44	RedOrangeZ	Not sure, can't re-create.

2018-08-10 08:40:22	RedOrangeZ	I don't think it's a chrome issue because I also have issues when trying to launch other programs.
2018-08-10 08:40:49	RedOrangeZ	So it seems like those programs are being prevented from opening/crashing potentially due to the same reason.
2018-08-10 08:40:54	TheBard	that's pretty vague. We have no idea what you may have done to your system, or how you have it setup.

2018-08-10 11:03:34	TheBard	the recovery partion probably would
2018-08-10 11:03:41	Devtron	everytime i get to the 1803 it start saying installing, but stays there for hours
2018-08-10 11:03:52	Devtron	restarting then causes windows to not boot
2018-08-10 11:04:00	Devtron	atm i am reinstalling the 3th time
2018-08-10 11:04:21	Devtron	is there a way to install or update win10 to the latest version around windows update
2018-08-10 11:04:43	naph-W	You can download the ISO directly from Microsoft
2018-08-10 11:04:57	TheBard	You might start with Windows, Settings, Update & Security, Troubleshoot and run the Windows Update troubleshooter. It might point a finger
2018-08-10 11:05:14	Devtron	did that 3 or 4 times doing my last try
2018-08-10 11:05:23	Devtron	fixed erros, and such but got stuck again
2018-08-10 11:05:36	Devtron	no virus checker or firewall
2018-08-10 11:05:37	TheBard	then naph-W's suggestion might work
2018-08-10 11:05:40	naph-W	https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10
2018-08-10 11:05:55	naph-W	Use the media creation tool
2018-08-10 11:05:58	Devtron	can that be used to upgrade or just reinstall ?
2018-08-10 11:06:16	TheBard	It will do both, if it works.
2018-08-10 11:06:18	naph-W	It will allow you to do both
2018-08-10 11:06:42	TheBard	Before you give up, did you try unplugging all connected hardware from it, USB, ext monitors, everything?
2018-08-10 11:06:58	Devtron	only thing connected is the powercord
2018-08-10 11:07:07	TheBard	Is there enough free drive space?
2018-08-10 11:07:07	naph-W	You might also consult the laptop mfg's support page to see if you laptop requires any updates (firmware, drivers, etc) to be compatible with 1803
2018-08-10 11:07:27	Devtron	I have tryed everything i could think off with 20 years of upgrading and reinstalling windows
2018-08-10 11:07:59	TheBard	how far does it get into the upgrade process before it goes into the corn field?
2018-08-10 11:08:22	Devtron	it installes every update, exept the 1803

2018-08-10 11:13:38	Devtron	Have not had this much issues reinstalling and updatiing windows since 95-98 hell even winxp
2018-08-10 11:14:22	rymate1234	to be fair each 6 monthly build is basically the equivalent upgrading a major windows version
2018-08-10 11:14:33	Devtron	true
2018-08-10 11:15:03	TheBard	We get to see this kind of thing fairly commonly.  Most of the time it's a driver that just wont update and it blows up at the very end.
2018-08-10 11:15:36	TheBard	The nice thing about it is that Windows recovers itself each time.  So all you lose is time.
2018-08-10 11:15:57	naph-W	I see a direct correlation to the OEM and the quality of their drivers/support
2018-08-10 11:16:10	naph-W	i.e. consumer machines are terribad
2018-08-10 11:16:12	Devtron	well this laptop update goes nuclear, so a total reinstall is nessary
2018-08-10 11:17:05	TheBard	I dunno about that naph. I have really dirt cheap Acer/Gatways that went fine, yet this Falcon Talon needs a high colonic every time...
2018-08-10 11:17:38	rymate1234	my mums cheapo acer works fine
2018-08-10 11:17:46	rymate1234	the only upgrade issue was from 8.1 to 10
2018-08-10 11:17:55	naph-W	I was contrasting consumer machines vs business class HP/Dell/Lenovo
2018-08-10 11:18:06	naph-W	Isn't Falcon an OEM for flight sim nerds?
2018-08-10 11:19:27	Devtron	Question: I have two problems with my desktop, the usb keeps rebooting every 60sec or so, even with just the keyboard connected, power savings have been disabled, but it still does it, and i cant find anything in event viewer

2018-08-10 17:20:56	WBILL	well im using a var which is the same as the cli the options are in the var variables %%<myvar>%

2018-08-10 17:21:46	garoto	just manually add the desired absolute path before the %%g var. e.g: D:\myvideos\processed\%%g
2018-08-10 17:21:52	garoto	perhaps
2018-08-10 17:22:30	garoto	removing the double quotes
2018-08-10 17:22:34	WBILL	you can pass all variables via the command line in the cli from my understanding i just need to know which one will delimit or what different var exclamation willlimit the output var to only the file name and no the full path of the file
2018-08-10 17:23:40	WBILL	ok ill try that
2018-08-10 17:23:57	WBILL	ill just amke the path have no spaces then
2018-08-10 17:24:14	garoto	%~ng for removing quotes and filenames expasion only of the %g var
2018-08-10 17:25:16	garoto	no spaces in dir structures are stil a good idea in 2018

2018-08-11 03:47:54	Aevum	so im working to create a multilanguage iso, i understand how it works, whats annoying me is that do i have to add the langauge pack to every installation index ?

2018-08-11 05:43:46	weq	Configureing the machine as a machine with limited bandwidth is the more appropriate and feasible method. Certain services will ultimately break without proper connection. Like the update service, you won't be able to block it.
2018-08-11 05:45:07	weq	If you have having issues with your machine consuming more bandwidth than you'd like it is a wiser choice to investigate the sources and act accordingly. Not carpet bomb the issue which most definitely will cause even MORE issues.

Basically I want a scale between linear motion and "enhance pointer precision" enabled. I don't like linear motion because it's hard to do precise motions, but turning on enhance results in erratic motion at higher speed.

2018-08-11 18:19:26	CptLuxx	and 60 eur for a hdd is .. much then

If that works fine, find someone random that's online and call them, too. If this also works, you should assume that the problem is on the other person's end (or somewhere between the two of you), so there's not much you can do about it.

2018-08-12 05:37:19	asig	[12:31:01] <MaximB> the issue is that this command asks for promp is I run it in ps, but when I put it into a .ps1 script and run - it doesn't do anything.  <--- the issue is "with" or "without" ps prompt?

2018-08-12 12:03:27	BrainStyle	Looking for help with Radeon display drivers for Windows 10
2018-08-12 12:04:22	jcotton	What specifically do you need help wit5h?
2018-08-12 12:05:32	BrainStyle	I built a computer about 5 years ago using Windows 10, an R9 270X GPU and an APU. I had it correctly installed with APU and GPU drivers working flawlessly. Since then either windows or user has updated drivers and now only the basic display adapter driver functions
2018-08-12 12:05:51	jcotton	Does anything in Device Manager have a yellow triangle?
2018-08-12 12:05:56	BrainStyle	Have completely uninstalled all drivers through DDU, AMDcleanup, Windows Device Manager as well
2018-08-12 12:06:11	jcotton	Also, have you tried reseating the card?
2018-08-12 12:06:23	BrainStyle	For the monitor yes, but not the GPU. Have uninstalled devices through safemode
2018-08-12 12:07:47	BrainStyle	I have, but I haven't texted the other PCI port yet. I've considered it a display problem, but maybe it's only partially functioning with basic driver and crashing with full driver?

2018-08-12 12:09:25	BrainStyle	And of course, attempting to use OEM or latest drivers either crashes or fails to install

2018-08-12 12:23:02	BrainStyle	From clean drivers, with only basic display adapter, attempted to install latest "supported" drivers, it finds the card, installs the driver then goes black/frozen with no display output anywhere.
2018-08-12 12:23:22	jcotton	Is there some utility to test the card?
2018-08-12 12:23:29	jcotton	Right now I'm done to reinstall Windows or broken card

2018-08-12 15:26:09	Ben64	"Your PC did not start correctly" "Press `Restart` to restart your PC, which can sometimes fix the problem. You can also press `Advanced Options` to try other options to repair your PC"

2018-08-12 15:27:59	txtechnow	Ben64 i guess the real question is this
2018-08-12 15:28:25	txtechnow	do you really want to spend a lot of time on this issue or do you just want to reinstall it and have a working machine in less than 10 minutes?
2018-08-12 15:30:13	 *	blkshp is happy to learn some people still think like this! 
2018-08-12 15:30:15	Ben64	if it does indeed result in a working machine, then that one
2018-08-12 15:30:23	Ben64	but i'm not super familiar with 10
2018-08-12 15:30:48	txtechnow	blkshp yea i used to be the same way. now i tend to try and prioritize the importance of those kind sof projects
2018-08-12 15:31:16	Stryyker	If you wish to repair the issue, find out the history.
2018-08-12 15:31:18	txtechnow	Ben64 i've heard of AMD drivers causing that kind of problem. latest windows updates causing that kind of issue
2018-08-12 15:31:43	txtechnow	Ben64 can u boot into safe mode with networking?
2018-08-12 15:31:47	Ben64	no
2018-08-12 15:32:11	txtechnow	is your friends data backed up?
2018-08-12 15:32:21	Ben64	nope
2018-08-12 15:32:46	Ben64	my plan was to put a linux live usb in to retreive the data if i was going to reinstall
2018-08-12 15:33:28	txtechnow	yea i guess that would be easier than taking the drive out of the system and plugging it into a working machine with an adapter or docking station
2018-08-12 15:33:46	Ben64	especially since it's a dell all-in-one, opening those is no fun
2018-08-12 15:34:26	txtechnow	i havent used a dell in years. do they have warranty limitations regarding opening a system?
2018-08-12 15:34:34	txtechnow	i know my hp system did
2018-08-12 15:34:47	txtechnow	anyway besides the point. but it might void a warranty
2018-08-12 15:34:57	txtechnow	i void warranties :) hehe
2018-08-12 15:35:02	Ben64	that's illegal in the us
2018-08-12 15:35:26	txtechnow	O_o
2018-08-12 15:35:53	Stryyker	what happened when you tried system restore?
2018-08-12 15:36:20	Ben64	lemme be more specific, it's illegal for companies to void warranty just because you opened it
2018-08-12 15:36:21	nate	txtechnow: I think he means HP voiding warranties (courts say companies can't void warranties for stuff like that)
2018-08-12 15:36:24	txtechnow	he can't use system restore
2018-08-12 15:36:32	txtechnow	he can't boot into the system at all
2018-08-12 15:36:35	Stryyker	All I remember is "it didn't work"
2018-08-12 15:36:43	Ben64	theres a system restore option in the boot repair thingy
2018-08-12 15:36:48	nate	txtechnow: System as in the entire computer or system as in just windows?
2018-08-12 15:36:53	txtechnow	nate ahh i didnt know that. ill look into that
2018-08-12 15:36:57	txtechnow	nate windows
2018-08-12 15:37:40	nate	Yeah usually Windows 10 has a bootup maintenance thing that will let you try to do restores/refreshes/etc from it if it detects failed boot-ins
2018-08-12 15:37:51	Ben64	no restore points have been created on your computer's system drive

While the one where I clicked install to begin with would appear to get stuck on 'initialising.' After a while I would get an timeout error message, with the error code of 0x800705b4. Does anyone here know why python is doing this? Thanks!

2018-08-12 20:08:51	shadowRAMM	odd, all I can think of is perhaps its a "smart" battery and there is a small bit of storage that your machine is trying to boot into.

2018-08-12 20:17:02	shadowRAMM	for a lot of the professionals on here, we typically frequent the channel more when its working hours either EST or Germanys local time zone.
2018-08-12 20:17:50	shadowRAMM	jorja: update the firmware to an older version. Then upgrade again. I've had a similar issue on a wifi router and that fixed it for me.

2018-08-12 22:06:24	mystica555	what is the easiest way to check a sha512 salted password on windows?  person keeps screwing up their webmail password, and I want them themselves to try the password that they have, without me resetting it, on the hash that is stored in my webmail system
2018-08-12 22:06:51	mystica555	i mean, i could have them download php, python, etc
2018-08-12 22:07:01	mystica555	but thats just derp if something is already built into windows or powershell to do this already
2018-08-12 22:09:24	shadowramm	a few weeks ago I found a powershell script that will generate the hash and check it against the haveibeenpwned.com API

2018-08-12 22:10:05	mystica555	not exactly what i want; that would be generating the hash; i already have the hash, and simply want the user to test what they think is their password against it

2018-08-13 04:46:14	weq	LibertyWeNeed: define success.
2018-08-13 04:47:10	LibertyWeNeed	working like it was just another PC, drivers functioning, track pad, sound, graphics (intel and nvidia), wifi, etc.
2018-08-13 04:47:19	weq	cause this sorta topic suggests that you are outside the scope of the channel. Bootcamp support etc is not something we deal with here, but the probably the mac community. We deal with Windows OS as-is.
2018-08-13 04:47:59	weq	yeah try the apple community for assistance with that. Bootcamp typically provides this stuff.

2018-08-13 06:12:09	zack6849	Jaca778: do you mean in a specific folder or the entire hard drive
2018-08-13 06:12:24	zack6849	also, this is probably going to get you told to ask in the windows development channel
2018-08-13 06:12:33	Jaca778	specific folder

2018-08-13 06:12:50	zack6849	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-08-13 06:13:17	weq	Coding/programming questions should be directed towards development channels such as ##windows-coding ##XAML ##csharp #win32 #winapi etc or a channel specific to your programming language. If you’re looking for a more appropriate channel you can use freenode's "alis" tool, with the command /msg alis help or ask #freenode.

2018-08-13 13:06:39	jcotton	Your Win10 install is a VM?
2018-08-13 13:06:45	bluesmonk	yes
2018-08-13 13:06:51	jcotton	And you turned on Hyper-V inside that?
2018-08-13 13:06:52	jcotton	Yeah uh
2018-08-13 13:06:53	jcotton	I don't think thsat's supported
2018-08-13 13:06:57	bluesmonk	I'm using virtualbox
2018-08-13 13:07:12	jcotton	What's the host OS?
2018-08-13 13:07:16	bluesmonk	that's the thing I'm missing perhaps
2018-08-13 13:07:23	bluesmonk	ubuntu 18.04
2018-08-13 13:07:39	jcotton	Yeah I don't think VBox really supports virt passthrough
2018-08-13 13:07:49	bluesmonk	crap
2018-08-13 13:08:00	jcotton	Just use Docker on Ubuntu
2018-08-13 13:08:01	bluesmonk	Is there an alternative?
2018-08-13 13:08:29	bluesmonk	I have, is just I have a docker-compose I have to test in a windows environment
2018-08-13 13:08:49	bluesmonk	for someone that can't docker and won't try
2018-08-13 13:08:56	jcotton	Ah
2018-08-13 13:08:59	bluesmonk	so, I have to, like, test it
2018-08-13 13:09:13	jcotton	You would probably need a bare-metal windows install to really test that
2018-08-13 13:09:21	bluesmonk	it seems so
2018-08-13 13:09:58	bluesmonk	is any alternative to vbox that supports this feature?
2018-08-13 13:10:13	jcotton	VMWare might do pass through
2018-08-13 13:10:14	jcotton	Not sure
2018-08-13 13:10:26	bluesmonk	cool, will google further. Thanks jcotton
2018-08-13 13:10:31	jcotton	One thing I would try is seeing if you can create a start a normal VM in hypervisor
2018-08-13 13:10:36	jcotton	*hyper-v
2018-08-13 13:10:36	strixdio	what are you trying to pass through?
2018-08-13 13:10:51	jcotton	Virtualization
2018-08-13 13:10:52	jcotton	VM nesting basically

2018-08-13 13:11:08	strixdio	I should though.

2018-08-13 13:11:35	jcotton	I don't know if any other scenario is supported by MS
2018-08-13 13:11:49	bluesmonk	but it seems it is not related to my issue
2018-08-13 13:12:16	strixdio	hmm, in display settings, my primary screen has options to rotate, but my 2ndary does not.
2018-08-13 13:12:54	TheBard	Mine does. Perhaps it is dependant on your card.
2018-08-13 13:13:04	strixdio	or maybe GP. :/
2018-08-13 13:13:06	TheBard	or maybe having the updated driver for your card

2018-08-13 17:27:22	Kadigan	The people at #macosx seem to disagree. I even recently had to fix a disk which I sort-of-intentionally broke. Couldn't get it done. :D
2018-08-13 17:27:47	NanoSector	disk utility is riddled with bugs
2018-08-13 17:28:01	NanoSector	it's inconvenient to use, even after toggling the drives on in the newest versions
2018-08-13 17:28:10	Kadigan	I made a dd image of a disk, which I then dd'ed over to a smaller disk - I only needed the first partition, so I didn't care for whatever came later... but I had to get rid of what remained of the second partition. Nope, no option. :D
2018-08-13 17:28:45	NanoSector	why didn't you just dd the first partition?
2018-08-13 17:29:09	Kadigan	Because I wanted the boot sector and whatever else was there, so I just dd'ed the whole thing (also got a full backup in the process)
2018-08-13 17:29:23	NanoSector	ah, mbr
2018-08-13 17:29:36	Kadigan	Also, step 1) make a .dmg image of a partition, step 2) swap HDDs, step 3) attempt to use the .dmg image to reconstruct this partition, step 4) get error that the .dmg you just made is "unsuitable for recovery" :D
2018-08-13 17:30:00	Kadigan	I <3 macOS :D
2018-08-13 17:30:07	Kadigan	But, anyway.

2018-08-13 17:30:19	NanoSector	i don't like that windows doesn't have built in options to writing iso's to disks
2018-08-13 17:30:27	NanoSector	seems everything but windows has it nowadays
2018-08-13 17:30:38	NanoSector	then again everything has a proper unzip utility but windows's is still bugged
2018-08-13 17:30:45	jcotton	NanoSector: it does to optical media
2018-08-13 17:30:47	jcotton	but not to USBs

2018-08-13 17:31:57	S_SubZero	"writing iso's to disks" you mean like writing a disk image to a DVD?

2018-08-13 19:15:21	jtnunley	Really? Because I heard that it’s sometimes on a different partition and might brick the system if it’s wiped. Also I’m not 100% sure if it’s UEFI or BIOS
2018-08-13 19:15:34	stevendale	You could remove the disk completely and the BIOS and UEFI would still run

2018-08-14 04:36:51	testuser	function, which also locks the CRITICAL_SECTION. Therefore, both adD() and find() lock the CRITICAL_SECTION, why is why the lock gets locked recursively. I'm wondering if this approach is ok and recursilve locking of the same lock is ok ?

What I've tried is this: rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /in /u /m "My prinstalled driver" /n \\cupsserver\printername    and I've also tried using powershell:  Add-Printer -Connection

2018-08-14 09:56:41	bongleger	Hello, is there a way to add a cups network printer on the command line using a preinstalled print driver? (It works, when using the graphical windows printer configuration wizard, but not when using the command line.) What I've tried is this: rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /in /u /m "My prinstalled driver" /n \\cupsserver\printername    and I've also tried using powershell:  Add-Printer -Connection
2018-08-14 09:56:47	bongleger	Name \\cupsserver\printername -DriverName "My prinstalled driver"   => gives my a "AmbiguousParameterSet", so this doesn't work either. :(

2018-08-14 09:59:28	WhiteDevil	hello i have linux running on this system
2018-08-14 09:59:44	WhiteDevil	so now if i install windows..will the boot menu for windows incorporate my linux systems also ?
2018-08-14 10:00:05	--	yctn is now known as ws2k3
2018-08-14 10:00:25	ntd	no, but there are ways to make that happen
2018-08-14 10:00:41	CptLuxx	##multiboot
2018-08-14 10:00:44	CptLuxx	we dont support dualboot
2018-08-14 10:01:08	WhiteDevil	there is no one in multiboot
2018-08-14 10:01:16	WhiteDevil	#multiboot
2018-08-14 10:01:18	CptLuxx	 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-08-14 10:01:19	ntd	anyway, if this is a uefi-capable system booting off a gpt drive the bios boot screen should let you select which bootloader
2018-08-14 10:01:34	WhiteDevil	no its not uefi
2018-08-14 10:01:35	weq	WhiteDevil: /msg alis list *dualboot*
2018-08-14 10:01:37	WhiteDevil	its an old system
2018-08-14 10:01:54	WhiteDevil	dude this is a windows question dont you think ?
2018-08-14 10:02:08	WhiteDevil	i need windows to do windows things
2018-08-14 10:02:17	weq	WhiteDevil: Then install windows and you are done.
2018-08-14 10:02:30	weq	We don't support dualbooting as said earlier.
2018-08-14 10:03:01	WhiteDevil	thats just odd
2018-08-14 10:03:47	WhiteDevil	and there isnt a decent channel on dualboot but i guess my mistake being i could use google and dint

2018-08-14 10:05:08	weq	Dualbooting is a whole can of worms with chaining bootloaders which we won't open. The use case for dualbooting is so narrow. Most people just tend to virtualize to utilize both worlds.
2018-08-14 10:05:15	weq	It makes more sense in this day & age.
2018-08-14 10:06:34	bongleger	WhiteDevil: you will most likely have to reinstall and update the grub boot loader (asuming you're using this one) afterwards. Anyway… you should make a backup/image of your system before.
2018-08-14 10:07:33	bongleger	WhiteDevil: "clonezilla" is a good tool for imaging your hard disk before the whole procedure
2018-08-14 10:08:07	CptLuxx	... bongleger its enough now
