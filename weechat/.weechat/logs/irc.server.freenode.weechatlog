2018-08-16 15:50:47	Foxboron	sircmpwn: We'd need logic to either detect them or have one hook for each service.
2018-08-16 15:50:49	Namarrgon	Oflor: you could try the -lts kernel with nvidia-lts
2018-08-16 15:50:56	sircmpwn	Foxboron: yeah, I'd assume there'd be a hook in the cronie package.

2018-08-16 15:54:44	sircmpwn	it shouldn't _be_ the arch way to break on updates

2018-08-16 15:55:14	sircmpwn	pacman hooks seem like a pretty good way of dealing with this. Cronie doesn't have any state which will be lost across a restart
2018-08-16 15:55:18	LeoB	hello there! I need some help: I instaled qemu and debootstrap from Arch repos in my Arch machine. After that I followed this procedure (https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2017/01/16/setting-up-qemu-kvm-for-kernel-development/) to set-up a VM on Arch using qemu.

2018-08-16 15:55:25	Oflor	Namarrgon: also, now after I installed bbswitch when I try to modprobe nvidia: modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'nvidia': No such device

2018-08-16 15:55:39	Namarrgon	Oflor: you'd have to power the gpu on first

2018-08-16 15:56:46	LeoB	But I have a problem: After boot, it says it can't find /dev/sda. Ps. I also omited -kernel and -append parameters, and the error persisted

2018-08-16 17:15:41	Argensis	I guess I could mount the partition in a Linux VM from within Windows and share it with Samba?

2018-08-16 20:15:47	joebobjoe	this is an error case on my part

2018-08-16 20:16:05	CubeTheThird	if I'm not mistaken you're getting that error because you can't pipe into cat simply
2018-08-16 20:16:27	joebobjoe	no because cat -h is not a valid parameter
2018-08-16 20:16:43	joebobjoe	it should print an error
2018-08-16 20:16:45	joebobjoe	I expected that

2018-08-16 20:17:27	joebobjoe	anyone know
2018-08-16 20:18:19	joebobjoe	other command line utils that print a lot of output do not output errors when piped to cat -h
2018-08-16 20:18:35	joebobjoe	all you get is the error message of the command that is erroring out, cat.
2018-08-16 20:18:40	joebobjoe	as expected
2018-08-16 20:18:54	CubeTheThird	does it give you a pipe error when piping to something that would actually accept it?

2018-08-16 22:32:47	chinchan	I'm currently using trizen

2018-08-16 22:33:39	ilmostro	henk1: auracle is from the same person as cower; it's something to do with how it probes the server; don't remember the details

2018-08-16 22:38:52	elibrokeit	henk1: basically cower sucked and was completely rewritten as auracle
2018-08-16 22:39:23	elibrokeit	chinchan: one of the advantages of being a Trusted User is getting to treat [community] like your own personal AUR
2018-08-16 22:39:28	henk1	elibrokeit: Yes, I read it just now. But it sucked on the maintenance side, so as user I wasn't aware
2018-08-16 22:40:04	elibrokeit	henk1: well, it also has never really handled the modern RPC interface well either
2018-08-16 22:40:37	elibrokeit	it used to send hundreds of requests for every cower -u, now it doesn't know how to split them at all, but at least avoids clobbering the server
2018-08-16 22:40:41	henk1	elibrokeit: Perhaps. But I only used 'cower -udf'

2018-08-16 22:44:21	ilmostro	yeah, I've had to stick with cower on my raspi2 with alarm; couldn't get auracle on there.  It works fine on my end, but I felt bad for "clobbering the server", as elibrokeit mentioned :p
2018-08-16 22:45:15	henk1	ah, yes, I noticed timeout issues. But not for several months now
2018-08-16 22:45:35	henk1	I assumed it was a server problem
2018-08-16 22:45:38	elibrokeit	that's because cower *finally* batches them all in one go

2018-08-16 23:54:10	noobybooby	so what is the issue here
2018-08-16 23:54:18	laudecay	there isn't, i was just confused
2018-08-16 23:54:19	noobybooby	it was a binary installer for macOS, two years ago
2018-08-16 23:54:23	noobybooby	that had the malware
2018-08-16 23:54:25	noobybooby	...
2018-08-16 23:54:32	noobybooby	ok
2018-08-16 23:54:32	laudecay	i didnt know the specifics
2018-08-16 23:54:37	noobybooby	well what a surprise

2018-08-16 23:54:43	noobybooby	that tends to confuse one
2018-08-16 23:54:44	mpan	laudecay: the keys were of an unrelated developer. The only thing at which uptream failed was their server security.
2018-08-16 23:54:47	noobybooby	rcf: heh right

2018-08-16 23:55:33	noobybooby	ehhh people are wrong about a lot of things often
2018-08-16 23:55:46	noobybooby	do your own research
2018-08-16 23:55:58	laudecay	anyway. what are the transmission options for setting up like a proxy or something?
2018-08-16 23:56:08	laudecay	deluge's are really good, how painful is it on transmission
2018-08-16 23:56:10	noobybooby	laudecay: "man transmission"
2018-08-16 23:56:17	noobybooby	or some similar thing
2018-08-16 23:56:25	noobybooby	I believe they might even have their own IRC channel
2018-08-16 23:56:25	mpan	laudecay: I’ve jused checked in the news to be sure. The attackers have signed the installer with a valid key of unrelated developer, so it could by accepted by MacOS. Then they put that version on Transmission’s website (but I can’t find now if it was an attack on the server or a MitM).
2018-08-16 23:56:49	laudecay	i would just throw it all behind a VPN but im running things on the same box that need access to the local network and network namespaces are annoyinggggg

2018-08-17 05:46:39	demfloro	you can try to reproduce it without starting X so if it's a panic you'll see it on the screen
2018-08-17 05:46:51	grawity	or set the sysctl kernel.panic=15, and see if that makes it reboot after 15 seconds during a freeze
2018-08-17 05:46:55	ineb	yes it loops the sound forever as far as i can tell. i waited for a couple of minutes
2018-08-17 05:46:59	earnestly	grawity: But every time this has happened to me, complete lock up, sound looping, etc.  It was due to RAM exhaustion.

2018-08-17 06:15:30	ineb	earnestly: i havent tried that. it could be possible with persistent mode of the driver
2018-08-17 06:16:42	ineb	there is a lot of room for improvement. forced powerstates and g-sync for vulkan and windowed applications for example.
2018-08-17 06:17:26	LordChaos	morphin: what's the version in the 4.14.x kernel?
2018-08-17 06:17:34	ineb	and other weird limitations like running a 144hz display forces the gpu to operate at max power draw all the time
2018-08-17 06:17:45	ineb	120hz on the other hand is perfectly fine for low power modes.

2018-08-17 09:46:35	grawity	the problem is that you're putting exec and exit inside a (subshell)
2018-08-17 09:46:55	grawity	( ) always creates a new shell subprocess, so any execs or exits (or variables, or...) only affect the subprocess

2018-08-17 09:53:11	ayekat	exec replaces your shell (and I would therefore advise against using it, because if something with your tmux setup is borked, you might lock yourself out of your shell)

2018-08-17 12:10:55	achillion	rymate1234: happens sometimes when you don't update in a while. Changes in the keyring come before changes in the signed packages, and if your keyring is out of date, even if you're -Syu'ing everything, the keyring needs to be updated first so you can get the tasty newly signed packages
2018-08-17 12:11:22	achillion	And they are Guaranteed Tasty
2018-08-17 12:11:40	rymate1234	surely this can be easily solved by updating the archlinux-keyring package first
2018-08-17 12:11:42	rymate1234	then the others

Is there some way to fix this?

Or (since we're already assuming they aren't just going to steal it) selecting exploits to be used on the running system later on according to the initramfs and kernel.

I have read that the font size is >12px, but in my dwm config im using "xos4 Terminus:size=9" and it seems to work but i dont understand why. In addition, if i change the 9 to 10 or 11 nothing happen. When i try 12 then the font is suddenly very big but probably is really 12. In summary: between 9-11 nothing

The problem is when my machine isn't connected to internet, it gives me a long error in tray. Can someone help me to write a script as if internet isn't availabel in machine, it won't lanunch the script, else it will show some symbol like font awesome # ( i can find that) just the script I need from you people.

Lately, when I boot my machine, the GDM service starts, but no graphical user interface is presented on the screen. systemctl status gdm doesn't show any errors. If I systemctl restart gdm I can get into my graphical session, and it works fine once I'm in. Anyone have any ideas as to why it wouldn't work on boot? Thanks. Mark.

2018-08-19 09:53:42	earnestly	lacrymology: Sigh, gdisk existed before fdisk got GPT support.  The c/s prefixes means curses/script.

2018-08-19 09:54:07	redruM	whislock: wouldn't it be faster for boot without the journal?

2018-08-19 09:54:37	earnestly	redruM: Literally the only reason this "meme" of using ext2 exists is because that was the only filesystem BSD supported for users who wanted to dual boot
2018-08-19 09:54:54	redruM	so stick with ext4 through out?
2018-08-19 09:55:09	earnestly	redruM: ext2/3 in our kernels are ext4 anyway, just ext4 with features disabled.

2018-08-19 13:02:34	elibrokeit	ddsh[m]: you'll need to make sure your boot manager knows how to find the ESP, if you were using grub before then you might need to use grub-install to create a new grub.efi executable (since it embeds the name of the partition containing /boot/grub/grub.cfg )

2018-08-19 16:29:25	elibrokeit	alad: for most projects I think it's safe to say a developer is anyone who hangs around and submits code more than infrequently, whereas "core devs" are the ones who can push to master

2018-08-19 16:30:27	alad	unless someone shows me otherwise, the main performance benefit from pacman is that 1. there are far less arch packages due to limited pathological splitting 2. our pkgbuilds have limited information on dependencies

Unless your repo databases are completely corrupted, force-downloading already-up-to-date ones accomplishes nothing other than to waste bandwidth and server load.
