2018-08-17 11:19:01	@laine	abcrawf, danpb: virsh edit allows adding a new <host> with the same <hostname> but different IP. So it looks like the extra validation is only done for virNetworkUpdate.
2018-08-17 11:20:03	abcrawf	laine: I was trying to figure out that syntax the other day (I'm pretty new to libvirt). Would you mind sharing your command?
2018-08-17 11:20:26	@laine	boot1: for people with lots of disks/hosts who want a way to categorize and manage them. If you're just doing a few VMs on a single host, there's no need for them. (I've been using libvirt since 2009, and never use storage pools)

2018-08-17 11:25:10	abcrawf	laine: thank you
2018-08-17 11:26:36	@laine	abcrawf: so you can add that new record with virsh edit, but it will only take effect after you virsh net-destroy, then virsh net-start the network. This has the unfortunate side effect of disconnecting all currently connected guests from the network.
2018-08-17 11:27:09	abcrawf	laine: heh, you read my mind. I was about to ask how to apply that.
2018-08-17 11:27:10	@laine	abcrawf: with a reasonably recent libvirtd, you can get the guests all reconnected by just restarting libvirtd.
2018-08-17 11:27:38	boot1	laine: do I need to configure a storage pool if I want my VM installed on a disk other than what libvirt is installed on?
2018-08-17 11:27:55	@laine	abcrawf: I don't recall how recent it needs to be, but definitely anything with a 4.x version will do it, and likely all 3.x.

2018-08-17 12:00:16	@laine	my recollection is that the pool is used to categorize and manage the volumes, but its name doesn't show up directly in the guest's config, so even if you had used it when creating a guest, you wouldn't need it later.

2018-08-17 12:03:08	boot1	laine if i change my config file for /var/lib/libvirt/images to point to my large partition I could eliminate all these autocreated pools?
