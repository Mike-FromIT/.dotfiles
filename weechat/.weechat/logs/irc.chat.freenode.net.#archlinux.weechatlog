2019-07-22 20:57:45	bigrick	ok I'm having some serious dns weirdness and need to get this out there. How can `dig` successfully get responses from my home dns server (10.0.0.20) while I'm not home? I don't even have an IP address on the 10.0.0.0/8 network. I created a paste of the issue: https://bhh.sh/5j3
