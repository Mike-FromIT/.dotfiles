2018-06-18 13:22:40	electricmilk	Setup encryption of the system partition with Veracrypt.  It started the encryption and came back over the weekend to "operating system not found".  It appears we had a power outage during the encryption.  Hard drive is not detected in BIOS or from Linux Live USB.  I booted to the veracrypt recovery CD I created but it can't detect a drive either.

2018-06-23 09:33:01	linyos	no one can answer these questions, because you provide a lack of context, due to a lack of understanding

2018-06-23 09:33:22	zenix_2k2	well currently what i am trying to do is just to escalate privilege

2018-06-23 09:34:22	zenix_2k2	and if you mean UAC, i already had UACme... i mean like if my payload is on a normal user
2018-06-23 09:34:28	Wulf	zenix_2k2: why not? It probably works in 30% of the cases.
2018-06-23 09:34:51	zenix_2k2	No actually, on a normal user it still requires admin's password to do some awesome jobsa

2018-06-23 09:41:49	linyos	it's a simple question
2018-06-23 09:41:51	zenix_2k2	it is just like something like metasploit without escalating feature yet, create a payload
2018-06-23 09:41:59	zenix_2k2	well the way you ask it has some problems

2018-06-23 13:36:31	simbalion	 Hi! I'm looking to improve my security and reduce my daily hassles. So I picked up a Yubikey Neo to experiment with, I like the ability to use OTP for sudo and SSH but when I set it up using /etc/pam/common-auth I discovered oh no, my E-mail client (thunderbird) can't log in. I can allow IMAP to use simple password but someone pointed out that'd be less secure. They're not wrong, of course, and IMAP isn't
2018-06-23 13:36:33	simbalion	as sensitive as SSH or sudo, but still worth locking down if possible. I looked into U2F as an alternative to OTP and discovered it's a lot of hassles to use it on remote servers. Yubikey seems to have a ton of options but only 2 can be used at one time? Can someone recommend the right direction to follow this in?

2018-06-23 13:45:50	simbalion	calmclam: oh cool! So I can use U2F for locking down my physical devices and still use the two auth modes for various online services! That's great news

2018-06-23 13:46:57	simbalion	I've been using 6-8 word passphrases for my device logins and obviously that sucks. Is it sensible to use U2F plus a much shorter passphrase, like 2 words?

2018-06-23 13:50:28	simbalion	calmclam: thats what I'd really like to do, eliminate the need for a password entirely wherever possible, but retain 2FA on certain sensitive machines
2018-06-23 13:50:52	simbalion	For example I should be able to use an SSH key + U2F to authenticate with sudo
2018-06-23 13:51:52	simbalion	the requirements to maintain a strong password these days are just absurd and its only going to get worse lol.. I use a password manager of course but I still have to remember a master passphrase plus one for each machine... what a headache

2018-06-23 17:04:38	Holo	I haven't had those installed for years now.
2018-06-23 17:04:51	@nate	Java and Adobe both have had shit tons via the browser plugins
2018-06-23 17:05:00	Nekomander	Todden, do you get how we're able to use our computers without an AV, and come out okay without a super hacked up machine? It's the results of from the things we've said.
2018-06-23 17:05:10	Todden	Nekomander, I actually do that

2018-06-23 17:05:26	@nate	What was it, 2014(?) I believe that Java made up something like 93% of payload malware or some shit according to cisco
2018-06-23 17:05:29	Nekomander	Todden, yet, you still plan to go to such sites for programs and what not?
2018-06-23 17:05:42	Todden	I just thought that considering how much more sophisticated attacks have got
2018-06-23 17:05:50	Todden	If it was a good idea to finally get some protection
2018-06-23 17:06:02	ntd	and in 2015, windows 10 was released with the universal malware compatibility layer (flash) bundled
2018-06-23 17:06:06	Todden	Nekomander, I do use private websites for stuff like that normally

2018-06-23 17:08:22	Nekomander	One of the worst things that could go with using genuine websites is that it doesn't use https, even so, that it's rather weak (using outdated stuff/server configurations) and/or it somehow gets MITM'd/intercepted and so on.
2018-06-23 17:08:23	@nate	Todden: pirate bay has been entirely questionable since they showed relation/connection to isohunt.to back during the whole 'staff fiasco' which popular consensus was that they were just a monitoring site

2018-06-24 17:39:11	hdqn	I don't think you can have a server decrypt something without having *any* knowledge of the results
2018-06-24 17:39:29	hdqn	you can avoid writing that to storage, but that's probably as far as it goes

2018-06-24 17:43:38	hdqn	if the decryption occurs client-side, you only need the client to generate a unique identifier when encrypting, and pair that with a decryption key, then store it on the server, no need to send any actual data, encrypted or not
2018-06-24 17:44:00	hdqn	I'm probably missing the point and use case for this, but... :P

2018-06-24 17:46:19	hdqn	I mean as long as you're never gonna send the data to the server, it'll never be able to decrypt something outside its reach, but if we take human error into account, then the question needs to be extended to "without having any knowledge of what its decrypting or being able to read the decryption key, while still providing it"
2018-06-24 17:46:37	hdqn	which kinda blows my mind and that'd be a great question :P

2018-06-25 20:22:18	flyback	it's a diode basically you apply power, one side gets hot and that acts as a wick that pulls heat from the other side so if you fan the hot side, the other side gets cold
2018-06-25 20:22:34	flyback	feel free to ask in ##electronics for help

2018-06-25 20:25:26	ponga2112	that shit would be GOLD in these parts
2018-06-25 20:26:36	flyback	yeah even at 1/10 speed fan slowly moving air is going to help some in a sealed car

2018-06-25 20:29:20	flyback	that's what dyson uses in his cordless vacs
2018-06-25 20:29:32	flyback	the other advantage is since it's electronically communitated

2018-06-25 20:29:53	flyback	but that's it
2018-06-25 20:30:11	flyback	for instance ac induction motors are limited to poles x frequency of ac
2018-06-25 20:30:25	ponga2112	ya, dc motors FTW
2018-06-25 20:30:32	flyback	which is why a lot of power tools, vacs use brushed ac motors because they don;t have a speed limit
2018-06-25 20:30:40	flyback	but they have short lives and noisy and waste power

2018-07-20 00:39:10	ziggylazer	Its how new information spreads from IETF
2018-07-20 00:39:10	d3vnull	those are the protocols that lots of technology functions on
2018-07-20 00:39:35	ziggylazer	d3vnull, huh?
2018-07-20 00:39:45	ziggylazer	Why point him to RFC?
2018-07-20 00:40:08	d3vnull	they are not always easy to read but they will give you a good reference to search on
2018-07-20 00:40:28	ziggylazer	No dont read  RFC's
2018-07-20 00:41:15	ziggylazer	There are so many ways to get that information in a much better format
2018-07-20 00:41:19	NinjaStyle	The more foundational knowledge the better imo.

2018-07-20 00:49:10	zenix_2k2	you mean the heap segment ?

2018-07-20 00:50:39	zenix_2k2	it likes allocating buffers in the stack segment ? at least that is how can i express in english
2018-07-20 00:51:05	zenix_2k2	usually used for allocating stuffs which you don't specifically know how much size/buffer of bytes you are gonna define
2018-07-20 00:51:42	zenix_2k2	malloc, realloc, free and one more function which is similar to malloc but i kinda forget, i don't use it much

2018-07-20 16:55:39	electricmilk	Why do UDP scans in nmap take so much longer than TCP scans? I thought UDP is supposed to be the must faster protocol..doesn't have the 3-way handshake and all.
2018-07-20 16:55:46	electricmilk	*much faster
2018-07-20 16:57:19	D2CTS92H	It's pretty much because of that exact reason; there's a much more generous timeout with UDP since you won't get the kind of session establishment you would with a TCP connection.
2018-07-20 16:57:23	spare	not depend more on target having reject setup rather than silently dropping and what you set -T to

2018-07-20 16:59:24	electricmilk	Ah okay.
2018-07-20 17:00:18	@sartan	electricmilk: depending on how many nodes you are scanning i recommend using zmap for simple port discovery, then feed those results back into nmap for service discovery
2018-07-20 17:00:38	@sartan	zmap uses low level raw sockets and doesn't actually open as ocket, rather relies on pcap library to inspect network for replies - there's no handle
2018-07-20 17:00:46	@sartan	this means it performs about 10 billion times faster
2018-07-20 17:00:50	@sartan	(that is a real metric!)

2018-07-21 10:05:05	wtflux	can someone help remind me what the vulnerable distro is that's used for pen testing...? there's a specific one, maybe Parrot-OS ?
2018-07-21 10:05:47	wtflux	If i remember correctly you load the Pen testing environment and then there's a static vulnerable distro loaded in a VM and you just practice teks and patched exploits on it

2018-07-21 14:16:32	D2CTS92H	The important point, in this context, is that they are ONE-WAY algorithms that (for the most part) always give a result that is the same if the input is the same, and no two inputs result in the same output (at least, ideally not).
2018-07-21 14:16:47	D2CTS92H	So you put a password in, it spits out a big string of text.
2018-07-21 14:16:51	D2CTS92H	Put the same password in, same string.
2018-07-21 14:16:57	D2CTS92H	Put a different password in, different string.
2018-07-21 14:17:05	zenix_2k2	but even if it is one-way, the way it encrypts stuffs still can't be TRULY random i think
2018-07-21 14:17:19	D2CTS92H	It's not random; the algorithms are all well-documented.
2018-07-21 14:17:20	zenix_2k2	so somewhere there has to be at least like 1 way to crack it ?

2018-07-21 14:17:31	@nate	it's not encrypting it
2018-07-21 14:17:33	D2CTS92H	So again they are one-way.
2018-07-21 14:17:36	@nate	it's literally not an encryption
2018-07-21 14:17:38	D2CTS92H	It's not encryption.
2018-07-21 14:17:40	@nate	there's nothing to be random
2018-07-21 14:17:42	D2CTS92H	You can't go backwards.
2018-07-21 14:17:50	@nate	I think we need to stop helping him and send him back to some basics stuff
2018-07-21 14:18:14	zenix_2k2	ok... yea, i should
2018-07-21 14:18:20	zenix_2k2	this is getting complicated

2018-07-21 14:20:46	iz	the cryptographic hash functions used for password hashing also should be tweaked so they are extra computationally expensive  (normal cryptographic hash functions are designed to run quite quickly and efficently)
2018-07-21 14:21:16	iz	(often this is done with repeated rounds through the same function)
2018-07-21 14:21:21	D2CTS92H	Right; because the only way to 'crack' them is to go through all the possibilities.
2018-07-21 14:21:36	D2CTS92H	If it's the authorized user and they have the right password; no problem, it only has to go through it once.
2018-07-21 14:22:00	D2CTS92H	But if it's someone trying to reproduce the result from the input, that is to say they are trying to get the password, then it slows them down.

2018-07-22 09:02:28	jeffree	This is stupid but I'm curious. I was just chatting with my isp about a modem problem and when I tried to type "1000" in the chat it would show as "####". I got a response, maybe automated, that the chat is encrypted but that the other person could still see what I said. What the hell does this mean? It makes no sense at all.

Considering banks are required by law to cover any such losses, I have no idea under what sort of contrived scenario this would ever be useful, except to make the ID theft insurance company tons of money they never have to pay out on.

2018-07-23 17:43:11	mpan	Hi. GnuPG compresses files when it encrypts them. How does it relate to CRIME-style attacks? Their page claims it’s “for added security”. I thought it would be quite opposite. Any clarification on that?

Just see what's in there. the packet are longer that normal DNS packet. and comes by 2 with 2 different headers.

2018-07-24 19:35:38	whislock	Client generates a keypair and a CSR. Sends CSR to CA. CA signs and returns signed certificate. Privkey is never sent to the CA. Where's the privkey escrowed?

2018-07-24 19:36:40	NinjaStyle	Why?
2018-07-24 19:36:50	whislock	Weird. My internal CA says otherwise.
2018-07-24 19:37:22	@nate	austincheney: Let's encrypt might disagree with you
2018-07-24 19:37:29	@nate	As would startssl from the days they weren't shit
2018-07-24 19:38:08	austincheney	either you pay for a CA as a service or you fund one internally like my employer which is a giant bank, but even still you have to pay for a CA because even if you have an internal CA in house it may not likely be a root CA
2018-07-24 19:38:18	austincheney	there needs to be a revocation chain to a root
2018-07-24 19:38:25	whislock	Uh. No.
2018-07-24 19:38:55	whislock	Nearly every Active Directory environment is running its own root CA. You can run a root CA from a Linux box in a closet if you know OpenSSL or gnuTLS decently enough.
2018-07-24 19:39:26	@nate	I feel like you're confusing issuing certs and getting certs.  Either way though you most definitely not need to pay for a basic DV cert, let's encrypt will give you them freely.  Past that internally you can create your own CA easily, many corporations do them and simply add their own custom CA to all corporate systems
2018-07-24 19:39:32	austincheney	AD is not a public facing entity
2018-07-24 19:40:06	austincheney	so long as your environment is completely inward looking you can do whatever you want with keys and certs
2018-07-24 19:40:12	whislock	It certainly can be. OpenVPN in most deployments relies on running your own root.
2018-07-24 19:40:24	@nate	That said as far as "eliminating passwords" go, your concept isn't even a new one, I'm kinda surprised it some how made it into draft form
2018-07-24 19:40:27	whislock	Also, the entire US DOD runs their own root for their websites.
2018-07-24 19:40:50	austincheney	yes, the DOD has 13 roots (i believe)
2018-07-24 19:40:55	austincheney	but that isnt normal

2018-07-24 19:42:06	whislock	nate: In some cases, yes. In most, though, they use the DoD PKI roots. I used to work for DoD.
2018-07-24 19:42:28	@nate	whislock: As have some of us in here :P
2018-07-24 19:42:31	@nate	Or are you talking internally?
2018-07-24 19:42:53	whislock	austincheney: Short answer is that there is nothing whatsoever stopping any website from creating their own root and using that to sign client certificates, none of which would cost money.
2018-07-24 19:43:01	@nate	Most of their public-facing stuff is all digicert (ie; army.mil, defense.gov, etc)
2018-07-24 19:43:09	NinjaStyle	Dod is weird. I've pentested some DoD stuff and the certs always stick out
2018-07-24 19:43:17	whislock	nate: There's a bunch of .mil websites that still throw browser errors if you're not trusting DoD PKI root CAs.
2018-07-24 19:43:23	NinjaStyle	Or the client from self signing tbh
2018-07-24 19:43:36	@nate	whislock: Yeah that's usually internal/employee stuff, like the old AKO system for example was a fuckin disaster

This is the key that is sent back to the user
2018-07-24 20:24:31	austincheney	the key is never stored on the server.  It is written into the browser's localStorage object.  JavaScript in the page tests for the presence of the written key and sends an asynchronous HTTP request to the server to tell the server the key is written.

2018-07-24 20:29:07	NinjaStyle	So I am an existing user signing in on a new device, go.
2018-07-24 20:29:35	austincheney	NinjaStyle, same exact process, but a second token is generated and saved to the given identifier on the server
2018-07-24 20:29:58	cheers	So if someone knows my secret identifier
2018-07-24 20:30:00	cheers	I'm screwed

2018-07-24 20:30:32	cheers	...so how's this any better than just using usernames and passwords
2018-07-24 20:30:33	whislock	So... It's two-factor asspain with one-factor security.
2018-07-24 20:30:57	NinjaStyle	whislock: seems to be
2018-07-24 20:31:03	dcollins	Wait. You need to remember the 60 character passphrase to log in on a new device? Or after a localstore is cleared?
2018-07-24 20:31:10	austincheney	cheers, users are generally really bad at forming and remembering decent passwords
2018-07-24 20:31:21	dcollins	Because if so, I think you've invented session cookies

2018-07-24 20:34:21	austincheney	whislock, if thats true then how did you pass CISSP?
2018-07-24 20:34:42	whislock	Believe it or not, it made more sense than you.
2018-07-24 20:34:59	austincheney	its hard to tell since you cannot seem a few lines of text

2018-07-25 00:23:41	domhnall	trivial question (sorry if crossposted) but seeking second opinion for a CVE.  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14438. According to upstream's report  https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14921, it affects only x86-Windows architectures. If anyone able to take a quick look and provide some insight if it's also relative to GNU/Linux I appreciate it. Thanks.

2018-07-25 02:13:43	knusbaum	you'd have to fix the vulnerable program.
2018-07-25 02:13:43	zenix_2k2	no i mean Linux or your distro's developres
2018-07-25 02:13:53	domhnall	well, could also be a vialble attack vector in some on-line pentesting lab.
2018-07-25 02:14:10	zenix_2k2	oh... well fine then
2018-07-25 02:14:19	knusbaum	zenix_2k2, the vulnerable praogram was one *he* wrote. And the only way to make it work, is to already have root access, to make it setuid.
2018-07-25 02:14:29	knusbaum	zenix_2k2, make sense?

2018-07-25 02:15:18	knusbaum	That is, if I don't have root on a machine, I can't write a vulnerable program and make it setuid, so I can't elevate my privileges.

2018-07-25 02:15:54	knusbaum	zenix_2k2, What he *does* say, is that if you don't have root on a machine, but can *find* a program that is setuid that already has the vulnerability, you can use it to get root access.

2018-07-25 02:16:54	knusbaum	The video totally skips over that fact. They don't show that he marked the vulnerable program as setuid.
2018-07-25 02:17:10	zenix_2k2	ok ok ok... pause at your first reply
2018-07-25 02:17:19	knusbaum	ok
2018-07-25 02:17:30	zenix_2k2	it doesn't make sense much, cause if it requires root access in the first place why would he even overflow it ?
2018-07-25 02:18:37	knusbaum	zenix_2k2, He's demonstrating a hypothetical. If he happened to *find* a program, like the one he wrote, that was setuid, he could attack it.
2018-07-25 02:18:58	knusbaum	zenix_2k2, it isn't a tutorial on how to break into linux.
2018-07-25 02:19:12	zenix_2k2	so do you have any good sources ?
2018-07-25 02:19:19	knusbaum	for what?
2018-07-25 02:19:27	zenix_2k2	escalating
2018-07-25 02:19:48	zenix_2k2	i think starting with linux first can be more ok than aiming Windows or strict OS
2018-07-25 02:20:06	knusbaum	Just look at the CVE list.
2018-07-25 02:20:30	knusbaum	If you're interested in real-world privilege escalation cases.

2018-07-25 02:21:11	zenix_2k2	Nya, i think exploit-db is only like a place where already written exploits are posted
2018-07-25 02:21:15	zenix_2k2	i wanna make one of my own
2018-07-25 02:21:40	knusbaum	zenix_2k2, then you need to have an extremely deep understanding of some existing code.
2018-07-25 02:21:57	knusbaum	"zero-day" exploits are very difficult to find.
2018-07-25 02:22:32	knusbaum	zenix_2k2, but as an example, you can reasonably mimic what they do in that video.

Assuming it isn't just that, a rumor, more than likely they're dropping it with i7's like they did with i5's and are focusing on HT in the i9's or now that they've largely hit the capable die size limits they might be trying to squeeze actual physical cores onto 14 and 10nm instead of using HT

2018-07-28 04:15:38	booyah	reed: also vpn providers sell user data sometimes.  best buy it over tor (using email created over tor) and pay in bitcoin
2018-07-28 04:16:14	booyah	bitcoin itself mighgt be tracked so buy it anonymously eg via cash using tor. if not possible then wait it in any way then mix it (eg convert to other coiuns and back) .
2018-07-28 04:16:19	reed	booyah: I have vpn enable locally, and I've check panop on tor browser. results was the same as for casual firefox
2018-07-28 04:16:35	booyah	bitcoin will be more private in a year or so when true mixing services will be more common
2018-07-28 04:17:01	booyah	yes, that fingerptint is probelm with the browser itself, not with the IP connection it goes through

2018-07-28 18:10:30	drumguy1384	MSC stands for Mobile Switching Center, it is the cellular equivalent of a phone exchange for cellular phones. It's the thing that directs your call to the wider network. You might be able to emulate this in software, but I wouldn't know how.
2018-07-28 18:11:33	Soulisson	ok
2018-07-28 18:11:46	drumguy1384	Also, all devices are registered with their respective networks and their communications are encrypted. You would need access to the encryption keys in order to establish two-way communications with the device.
2018-07-28 18:12:30	drumguy1384	the SIM card has one side of the key, but the cell provider is (theoretically) the only one who has the other part of the key.

2018-07-28 18:19:14	drumguy1384	The article says plainly that you can sniff all traffic from anyone that connects to you.

2018-07-28 18:23:17	drumguy1384	This is basically a man in the middle attack. You create a software defined BTS and register everyone around to you unencrypted, sniff it, then pass that data through a GSM  dongle to a legitimate cell provider. I'm with Burgundy ... I would avoid messing with this if you value your freedom.
2018-07-28 18:24:07	drumguy1384	Although, the authors do say that it can be used to create a private GSM network for personal use.
2018-07-28 18:28:23	Soulisson	drumguy1384, but I would have to put a SIM card in my GSM dongle, no?

2018-07-28 18:28:56	drumguy1384	in order to pass through it needs a legitimate connection to an outside network

2018-07-28 18:42:59	drumguy1384	As configured out of the box, if you fire this thing up without an outside connection it will amount to a denial of service attack on all of your neighbors. If you do it with an outside connection it is fraud, theft, and probably a few other things that can get you in serious trouble.
2018-07-28 18:44:03	Soulisson	drumguy1384, i won't do it. I'm just curious
2018-07-28 18:44:44	drumguy1384	If configured properly, the authors do suggest that it can be used as a private network to talk between handsets without touching anything outside, but I would make sure you configure it carefully before starting it up.

2018-07-29 04:44:10	hdqn	it's a system service so I'm assuming it runs as root

2018-07-29 04:48:49	hdqn	🤔
2018-07-29 04:48:54	hdqn	then why are you suggesting it to me?
2018-07-29 04:49:16	catbeard	just as an example of what you can do with a reverse tunnel, -R is very nice
2018-07-29 04:49:34	catbeard	i don't have the unit file unfortunately
2018-07-29 04:49:50	catbeard	ah yes i do

2018-07-29 04:50:25	hdqn	except establishing a shell on the remote host

2018-07-29 18:27:47	flyback	for a ls -lrtWHATEVER on a bunch of drives i have lying around that I an trying to image then elminate
2018-07-29 18:27:59	flyback	yet another way to defeat my ocd :
2018-07-29 18:28:00	flyback	P
2018-07-29 18:28:48	flyback	sheesh should have thought of this earlier
2018-07-29 18:29:14	flyback	cause you know, when you are trying to organize shit you can't have all plugged in at once, you get tired of swapping drives in and out
2018-07-29 18:29:55	flyback	so dumping the metadata? (I think that's what this is) allows me to put all that info together to decide what can go where first since I don't have enough spaCE TO raw image everything I own

2018-07-29 21:38:03	@nate	for the love of god these silly ass bitcoin "I saw you watch porn" emails are so obnoxiously silly
2018-07-29 21:38:17	@nate	I feel like there's some 12 year old behind these things just from the effort they put into it
2018-07-29 21:38:53	@nate	"I have a unique pixel within this e-mail, and at this moment I know you have read this email message", literally a plain text email, doesn't even send an HTML email header let alone contain email, like come on man, at least actually include one, not even that hard

2018-07-30 00:20:41	@wilsonfisk	gr8: where?
2018-07-30 00:20:47	Apachez	also the security model of linux makes it harder for them to spread
2018-07-30 00:20:50	@wilsonfisk	that's totally not the main reason
2018-07-30 00:21:06	Apachez	so its more specific vulns for vulnerable versions of lets say ssh that noone sane uses any longer
2018-07-30 00:21:27	nisstyre	Linux has no security model haha
2018-07-30 00:21:28	Apachez	well in linux you have root and thats it
2018-07-30 00:21:31	nisstyre	what do you mean?
2018-07-30 00:21:37	nisstyre	the security model is whatever the user decides on
2018-07-30 00:21:44	Apachez	in windows you have both system and trusted_installer who have higher previleges than local admin
2018-07-30 00:21:50	norkle	maybe linux isn't for the novice?
2018-07-30 00:21:53	gr8	Apachez, that's what I thought
2018-07-30 00:21:53	nisstyre	you can run random scripts from the internet and open your firewall if you choose
2018-07-30 00:22:06	Apachez	so with a windows box YOU are not the admin, the malware is :)

2018-07-30 03:53:31	MySecondNick	Hello guys
2018-07-30 03:53:51	MySecondNick	if I have a dynamic IP adress (which resets every time I restart my router), which parts of my address are constant?
2018-07-30 03:54:39	MySecondNick	I have 4 "fields" - from the leftmost to the rightmost -  which ones are constant so that my subnet within the internet is identified?
2018-07-30 03:56:17	@nate	none
2018-07-30 03:56:49	MySecondNick	nate OK so what I have is this - a log of devices in a Facebook account with their IP adresses
2018-07-30 03:56:51	@nate	Each of the 4 octets can change completely
2018-07-30 03:57:02	MySecondNick	how can I know if someone else has accessed my account?
2018-07-30 03:57:34	@nate	Largely by making sure you're being sane with passwords (strong passwords, never reusing, not falling for phishing stuff, etc) and attempting to geoip lookup the IP's to see where they're based
2018-07-30 03:57:54	@nate	Not necessarily 100% accurate but at most geoip data for residential IP's will get -close- citywise
2018-07-30 03:58:00	avu	a whois lookup on the IPs to at least see if they all belong to your ISP can also help
2018-07-30 03:58:24	@nate	That too, most geoip tools will probably tell you the ISP owner as well so that's also a good step

2018-07-30 04:01:08	MySecondNick	if the ASN's between two IP adresses differ
2018-07-30 04:01:19	MySecondNick	does that mean that there were different networks

2018-07-30 04:02:54	@nate	Usually it could, some have more than one (AT&T for example I think have like a dozen different ASN's for different services of theirs)
2018-07-30 04:03:04	@nate	but simplest way is just to see who the ASN owner is
2018-07-30 04:03:12	MySecondNick	how can I do that?
2018-07-30 04:03:35	@nate	Generally any sort of tool for looking up an IP info should show you basic ASN details in the lookup
2018-07-30 04:03:45	MySecondNick	like the owner and other stuff?
2018-07-30 04:04:28	@nate	Yes, IP information is public data, not really anything secret to it

2018-07-30 23:47:40	@wilsonfisk	when in all honesty I couldn't care less, just trying to save someone tons of lawyer fees and time but if they don't want it cest' la vie :3
2018-07-30 23:48:33	D2CTS92H	It doesn't make sense to anonymize e-mail traffic about a potential business relationship if you intend to register an LLC, which would open you to exposure of identity as tied to whatever activity you're participating in regardless of how anonymous your 'conversations' were.
2018-07-30 23:48:48	D2CTS92H	Notwithstanding the 'Arizona, United States' sets off my 'foreigner passing off as domestic' alarms.
2018-07-30 23:49:01	@wilsonfisk	rofl, now you can register for a LLC *without* giving up and identifiable information...
2018-07-30 23:49:23	@wilsonfisk	do you even know what an LLC is?
2018-07-30 23:49:30	D2CTS92H	Presumably the LLC would be the target of legal action.
2018-07-30 23:49:36	@wilsonfisk	and if you actually need one being a certified reseller?

2018-07-30 23:57:31	@wilsonfisk	you *can*, it tends to be more difficult though
2018-07-30 23:58:38	@nate	Here in PA an LLC has to have a publically registered 'agent', and that agent has to have known/documented association to the effective owner if the agent themselves aren't
2018-07-30 23:59:32	@nate	Though that might largely be due to the fact LLC's in PA are treated as corporations when it comes to tax shit

2018-08-02 17:27:42	purpleunicorn	the more you modify it to your own standards the more identifiable you become
2018-08-02 17:27:56	cheers	yeah, exactly

2018-08-03 06:25:50	darkhanb	so my question is: is there a way to monitor SSL traffic of the computer if you only have the complete access to the router that computer is connected to?
2018-08-03 06:27:52	catbeard	if everything points to the router and you have a CA that's installed on client PCs that's capable of on the fly ssl re-signing
2018-08-03 06:28:15	catbeard	like squid with ssl bump
2018-08-03 06:28:32	iz	also, if the computer is making an SSL connection _TO_ the router :b
2018-08-03 06:28:50	spare	you can get metadata ? but given the entire ecommerce system is based on tls and involves routing through other peoples nodes if you could bad things would happen and alot of people would probably care pretty quickly

2018-08-03 06:34:47	darkhanb	Is this assumption correct? As long as all root CA's are valid in the client's computer. No one can view the SSL traffic between that client computer and the server it's talking to. Not an attacker who has full access to the client's router, nor a government controlled ISP, etc..?

2018-08-03 11:17:54	@wilsonfisk	xp0inter: You could check online to see if there's useful that will allow you to disable  (or elevate privs so you can), like a service manual. You could pull the firmware from the device or download it, poke and prod and maybe find something useful. Or you could save some time and just buy your own modem.

2018-08-03 16:22:24	viq	hiya: it isn't only about who will host signal, because there are many places that could. The issue is about domain fronting, which allowed them to pretend to be something which they weren't, in hopes of avoiding being blocked. For example Iran won't block whole AWS or GCE ranges. But they probably would block whole OVH/Hetzner ranges.

2018-08-03 23:55:19	mrush	well, a login page could expose a database. i'd say generally, checksum static content before the site is live and when files change, and for an auth database perhaps you could dump and compare at less frequent intervals?
2018-08-03 23:55:35	aleph-TA	you could probably keep a 'good' copy of it and wget -> sha and diff it
2018-08-03 23:56:01	mrush	you should also implement NSM to escalate alerts
2018-08-03 23:56:38	cheers	mrush: i was asking more from the perspective of a user, not an administrator
2018-08-03 23:56:46	mrush	ah
2018-08-03 23:56:47	cheers	like, protonmail does clientside encryption

2018-08-03 23:58:02	cheers	they use SRP for passwords, so they ever supposed to leave your system

2018-08-03 23:59:44	mrush	as aleph-TA mentioned, you could wget $url |sha512sum
2018-08-03 23:59:55	cheers	hmm, yeah
2018-08-04 00:00:01	mrush	the discover whether the static content has been altered

2018-08-04 00:00:51	mrush	^^
2018-08-04 00:01:14	xp0inter	that would be almost impossible, you have to fetch all the external files and checksumming them. and a single change you be alarmed
2018-08-04 00:01:50	mrush	yep
2018-08-04 00:02:25	cheers	oh, welp.
2018-08-04 00:02:27	aleph-TA	the login page only has 17 resources, not too bad
2018-08-04 00:02:39	cheers	could do a diff or something, i suppose, combined with a fuzzy hash
2018-08-04 00:02:42	mrush	cheers: are you just looking for general ideas, or is there a concrete use case? if the clients have a trusted administrator then you should distribute x509 client server credentials
2018-08-04 00:03:06	mrush	imo
2018-08-04 00:03:09	xp0inter	if you're so scared of scripts you better try to use the page without them.
2018-08-04 00:03:11	aleph-TA	i think if their servers are compd you have bigger problems
2018-08-04 00:03:14	cheers	the use case i had in mind was verifying the integrity of the protonmail login page against a known-good copy

2018-08-10 05:18:17	spb	mrush: buffer overflows are a pretty general class of bug, which can be triggered by a number of things. length of input is the most common, but it sounds like you've encountered one of the other causes
2018-08-10 05:18:54	mrush	spb: do you know of any reading material which discusses the other causes in depth?
2018-08-10 05:19:29	spb	they mostly boil down to broken program logic; to be more specific than that tends to get into specifics of individual bugs

2018-08-10 06:04:47	spb	in counter mode, it creates a keystream that is encrypt(iv, key, 1) || encrypt(iv, key, 2) || encrypt(iv, key, 3) || ...
2018-08-10 06:05:01	kay8300	what's the 1, 2, 3
2018-08-10 06:05:09	spb	the numbers 1, 2, 3
2018-08-10 06:05:17	spb	AES has a 128-bit block size, so it'll create 2**128 distinct blocks before it wraps around and repeats
2018-08-10 06:05:45	calmclam	a good iv looks really important
2018-08-10 06:05:51	spb	each of those blocks is 128 bits long, which is 16 bytes, so the keystream will be 2**132 bytes before repeating
2018-08-10 06:06:06	spb	where 'good' means 'unique', yes
2018-08-10 06:06:19	spb	the IV isn't secret; it's usually sent along with the ciphertext
2018-08-10 06:06:25	kay8300	ok so if ur only encrypting like 32 bytes of data, what happens?

2018-08-10 17:04:35	@nate	in the US any access to a non-public wifi network without permission falls under computer act violations

2018-08-10 17:08:40	@nate	That doesn't necessarily mean someone is on your wifi, speeds can vary dramatically (especially cable based lines), and ISP's can easily be wrong if they have actively rotating IP's
2018-08-10 17:08:44	spare	you can track the signal strength of the thing broadcasting association to your router
2018-08-10 17:08:48	patr0clus	i did that too.

2018-08-10 17:09:36	@nate	patr0clus: Honestly change your passphrase to something stronger and don't use weak wireless security (ie; only use WPA2-AES/CCMP), then contact your local authorities and see if they'll do anything about it
2018-08-10 17:09:37	patr0clus	i can do that.
2018-08-10 17:09:56	Oladon_work	Alternatively, you could do what @nate said.
2018-08-10 17:10:00	patr0clus	do you think the local cops will care?
2018-08-10 17:10:07	patr0clus	i have.
2018-08-10 17:10:16	Oladon_work	Unlikely, imo, but depends on your district.
2018-08-10 17:10:17	@nate	Probably not if it's not caused you any legal trouble so far
2018-08-10 17:10:38	patr0clus	so theres likely nothing much that can be done except change my pass?
2018-08-10 17:10:38	@nate	most don't have the time, personnel nor equipment to generally look into shit like that
2018-08-10 17:10:43	patr0clus	via the law
2018-08-10 17:10:49	patr0clus	i guess
2018-08-10 17:11:16	@nate	so unless someone used your wifi to get child porn or some shit and it's coming back on you, they're not gonna likely put effort into it since all you got so far was a warning about pirating from your ISP (which could be entirely accidentally given)
2018-08-10 17:11:52	@nate	Past that no, change your pass and like I said check your security settings, if you're using a weakened wifi set up then they'll prob just be able to get back in
2018-08-10 17:12:05	patr0clus	so as long as hes not committing actual crimes on my ip, theres little i can realistically do. ok. well, good to know.
2018-08-10 17:12:31	Oladon_work	patr0clus: Incidentally, most wifi routers support MAC filtering as well as strong passwords
2018-08-10 17:12:43	@nate	The closest you might be able to get is if your router has the capacity of showing connection strength to wifi clients that would prob give you a general clue of their distance, but past that, get to know your neighbors and find out which seem tech saavy

2018-08-11 04:49:45	kopper	I'm not telling to restate it

2018-08-11 04:52:04	@nate	The main thing is though that section and others put emphasis on basically that you should wipe it once things aren't needed anymore, but that also is open to pretty broad interpretation.  Bigger problem is that what you interpret it as and what the EU might go after you legally for in -their- interpretation could be two very different things

2018-08-11 18:15:59	daniel_g	i managed to get it to work. here's a log of my efforts: http://paste.debian.net/1037598/ for some reason, when I si out of greeting, it works in gdb (a shell is spawned), but when I "n", I get "cannot find bounds of current function" Anyone know why? Regardless it works when I just run the program with args from the command line.

2018-08-11 18:39:19	daniel_g	man, if it was this difficult to perform a buffer overflow on an outdated system by disabling protections, I can only imagine how tricky it would be to overflow a modern system, ha!
2018-08-11 18:40:03	kype	Is there a tool to detect the differences between servers? Eg. i have 5 web servers serving the same content (load balanced). As part of a intrusion detection strategy, i would like to constantly monitor the network traffic and host-based parameters (running processes etc.) of the 5 servers constantly and detect the one server that stands out / acts differently.
2018-08-11 18:40:32	_Shurik_	perhaps would be easier to just write your own
2018-08-11 18:41:13	kype	yeah that what we are planning to if we dont find any such tool, i tried searching around but i dont know the exact term to call this strategy....differential analysis seems wrong.

2018-08-12 16:00:00	Apachez	so if you slow it down to compare (as an example) one char per second that would take 32 seconds to get an answer if its a good or bad password
2018-08-12 16:00:20	Apachez	sirvictory4: due jailtime due to hacking government it-systems
2018-08-12 16:02:30	@wilsonfisk	Apachez: if only it were that easy. Getting a cert can be hard!  ;3
2018-08-12 16:03:10	@wilsonfisk	well *harder* ; depending on the govt. and the branch.
2018-08-12 16:03:40	@wilsonfisk	I hear, hacking is bad and you shouldn't do it.

2018-08-13 02:26:23	Tazmain	as it turned out
2018-08-13 02:27:43	Tazmain	actually what has been the latest on this? openBSD is disabling hyper-threading due to this, so what are we going to do? Wait for a new CPU release or go AMD
2018-08-13 02:28:32	@nate	As far as I'm aware OpenBSD is disabling HT over other things, largely for drama-inducing purposes

2018-08-13 02:29:08	@nate	Disabling HT doesn't actually "fix" anything, they're doing it because they "think" it "might" prevent future issues
2018-08-13 02:29:28	@nate	According to OpenBSD's argument yes (despite decades of data disputing them)
2018-08-13 02:29:43	Tazmain	the performance gain ?
2018-08-13 02:29:56	@nate	Perhaps they simply never implemented HT properly anyways (since it is largely OS-level implemented) and thought this was a generic way for them to lazily remove it rather than fix it
