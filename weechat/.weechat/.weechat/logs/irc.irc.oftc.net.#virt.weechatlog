2018-08-18 11:55:42	juanmapalad	i dont have administrator access in my laptop
2018-08-18 11:55:58	juanmapalad	whats why i ned to remove myself as a user
2018-08-18 11:58:29	catpig	i dont know what you mean
2018-08-18 11:58:44	rymate1234	how'd you get the laptop?
2018-08-18 11:59:20	catpig	here's instructions on removing a system from a domain (but, ofc, you need admin for that) https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd277423.aspx
2018-08-18 11:59:50	juanmapalad	i have a username and pw that has no administrator privilege
2018-08-18 12:00:00	catpig	so if it's your laptop.. just reinstall. if it's your employer's laptop, ask IT for the local admin password
2018-08-18 12:00:05	rymate1234	^
2018-08-18 12:00:28	juanmapalad	is there a way to bypass it aside from reformat and asking it to the IT?
2018-08-18 12:00:38	catpig	well, if it's your laptop you could also ask the previous owner for the admin password, but i'm assuming that's not possible
2018-08-18 12:00:47	rymate1234	juanmapalad, there isn't a way around it
2018-08-18 12:00:51	juanmapalad	its a company owned
2018-08-18 12:01:00	rymate1234	otherwise there'd be no point having the protections in the first place
2018-08-18 12:01:02	catpig	juanmapalad, then speak to the IT department
2018-08-18 12:01:09	rymate1234	which as it's a company laptop are there for a reason most likely
2018-08-18 12:01:34	catpig	also, i would advise against trying to turn off security measures on your company laptop without asking IT
2018-08-18 12:01:48	catpig	i should think you can get in serious trouble for that
2018-08-18 12:02:03	rymate1234	yeah

Check with your other vendors and manufacturers if their devices still do not appear in this browse list after Windows devices appear; it is likely they have this protocol disabled or only support SMB1.
