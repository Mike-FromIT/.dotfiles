I'm just setting it back up now but I can't seem to get the GPU to "click" into the motherboard. Like it's only halfway in, and when I boot with the GPU it flickers due to incorrect seating.
2018-06-13 13:18:01	@DoctorDick	Reseat it

2018-06-13 13:39:46	@Donjuanal	because passed doesnt mean there arent problems
2018-06-13 13:40:08	system16	no
2018-06-13 13:40:18	system16	senayoshi, what happened ?
2018-06-13 13:40:42	system16	no we didnt look at that Donjuanal

2018-06-13 13:41:56	system16	we are trying to mount that 128 GB drive
2018-06-13 13:42:42	@Donjuanal	so it's not mounting?

2018-06-13 13:42:53	@Donjuanal	copy the output of lsblk and put it on pastebin
2018-06-13 13:43:22	system16	linux sees that drive but cant mount it
2018-06-13 13:43:53	system16	smartmontools can see the drive ( based on what he/she said)
2018-06-13 13:44:00	@Donjuanal	then that's all we need

2018-06-13 18:47:07	kansas	I have 2 Excel data sets that need to be merged into one big table. Been playing around with Merging them with powerquery in Excel but that's not been working. Another thing that I maybe thought of doing is exporting the data to Access and then updating (I think there's a way to not do it manually) and keeping track of it there.

2018-06-13 18:57:11	Joe_Q	I was in here a few days ago where several of you identified old thermal paste as leading to high CPU temps, which in turn were causing random reboots
2018-06-13 18:57:49	Joe_Q	The cooler is a Deep Cool model. Don't have the model number. Fan and heatsink in one unit
2018-06-13 18:58:09	@PipeItToDevNull	It is just fan, not liquid?
2018-06-13 18:58:13	Joe_Q	The fan is about 13 cm in diameter.
2018-06-13 18:59:04	Joe_Q	Yes, just metal heatsink with the fan on top. Was working fine for a while, then a few months ago I started getting random reboots. On advice here, ran the stress test with HWinfo logging, which revealed high temps. I was advised to clean off and re-apply thermal paste -- which I've now done three times

2018-06-13 18:59:24	Joe_Q	CPU still running hot. Within 20 seconds after powering on, CPU temps were up in the 90s.

2018-06-13 19:02:47	Joe_Q	Is there any chance that the temp sensors on the CPU are messed up? I can't understand why the CPU would get so hot right after bootup
2018-06-13 19:03:25	@PipeItToDevNull	How are you applying paste?
2018-06-13 19:04:23	Joe_Q	A small amount (about half the size of a garden pea) on the middle of the CPU top surface, then clamp the HSF on top
2018-06-13 19:04:43	Joe_Q	I also tried applying somewhat more than this, didn't help
2018-06-13 19:05:09	Joe_Q	I also tried applying the paste to the middle of the heatsink flat surface (instead of the CPU top surface) which also doesn't seem to make a difference
2018-06-13 19:05:44	@DoctorDick	Fuck that's hot for that CPU
2018-06-13 19:06:01	Joe_Q	Watching my CPU temps in Speccy, in one second they jump from 48C to 58C (to use an example)
2018-06-13 19:06:15	@DoctorDick	Maybe your cooler is bad
2018-06-13 19:06:30	Joe_Q	Yes it is hot. You had made a similar comment earlier. I don't know how the machine keeps going at that temperature TBH, I would think it'd power itself down immediately
2018-06-13 19:06:44	@DoctorDick	61C is the max temp
2018-06-13 19:07:00	Joe_Q	What does "max temp" mean in this context? As in, the max safe temp without damaging it?

2018-06-13 19:08:13	Joe_Q	The thing is, apart from the very random and infrequent reboots, the computer is behaving pretty normal

2018-06-13 19:15:45	@NonePizzaLftBeef	its likely you simply aren't properly mounting the heatsink or it was somehow defective
2018-06-13 19:17:16	Joe_Q	Here's what I'm doing: 1. Small amt of thermal paste on middle of top surface of CPU. 2. Place flat part of heatsink on top of CPU, squishing the paste in the process. 3. Clamp heatsink to the tabs on the mobo
2018-06-13 19:18:48	Joe_Q	What has me wondering, is that the temps bounce around alot as I watch them in Speccy. I can be sitting at 47C and then in one second it jumps up to 63C
2018-06-13 19:19:04	Joe_Q	Then goes back down to 47C over 6-7 seconds.
2018-06-13 19:19:16	@NonePizzaLftBeef	speccy isn't valid for that sort of analysis
2018-06-13 19:19:23	@NonePizzaLftBeef	thats what hwinfo is for
2018-06-13 19:21:03	Joe_Q	Okay, I'm going to run the hwinfo logging feature while I just work on Gmail and Wordpress a bit, then upload so you all can see the trends

The license I want to buy is a Microsoft Open Value one and the details says '1 Year Acquired Year 1', what does that mean? Can I keep using this software after a year?

2018-06-14 02:39:00	andymcb1	I want to run my desktop off of a solar charged system (12v). I already have the power supply and everything works OK. Is there any way I can tell Windows 10 the status of the battery, so I can get features such as hibernate when the battery voltage gets too low.
2018-06-14 02:42:57	@Swede	you would have to build that yourself. Like with an arduino
2018-06-14 02:43:49	andymcb1	I am comfortable doing that. Any idea on how I do that on the software side within windows 10?
2018-06-14 02:43:51	@Swede	a smart UPS might have this feature, but this isn't what you have right
2018-06-14 02:44:14	andymcb1	Nah, I have 12V deep cycle AGM batteries, and a pico PSU from ebay.
2018-06-14 02:44:49	andymcb1	I can always write my own app in C# to sit on the dock and receive messages over a serial connection from the arduino.
2018-06-14 02:45:37	@Swede	yeah you would need something like that. There are console commands to hibernate. Also APIs most likely
2018-06-14 02:46:21	andymcb1	Hm yeah, dang. I'll do some more research to see if I can tap into it the same way a laptop would.

Is it the motherboard? http://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/9221647 any ideas?

2018-06-14 03:34:12	andymcb1	Does the BIOS see the drive?
2018-06-14 03:34:24	BootThePC	I also have the hard drive which isn't registering as a device for some reason aswell... what do you think?
2018-06-14 03:34:55	BootThePC	It sees the SSD which has windows, but not the harddrive which is kind of secondary right now. I could fix that pretty easily I would think

2018-06-14 03:46:51	BootThePC	Still nothing
2018-06-14 03:47:37	BootThePC	Like, when I try to boot it from the SSD it goes to a black screen, then on the left side those old white underscore things appear time to time like on the system command prompt before you type something
2018-06-14 03:47:49	BootThePC	After that, it just goes black again and then boots back to BIOS

It is weird because when I plug it in & flip the switch on the back of the PSU there is a light on the MOBO that flashes. After the initial flash of light for a second, the fans and MOBO stay off. Then I hit the power button on the case, and still nothing. I'll take

2018-06-14 10:46:49	xeodeuk	I have an Asus Zenbook UX303L that's got 4gb onboard ram (can see the Micron ICs in the mobo) that apear to be giving loads of errors in memtest.  Can onboard ram be disabled somehow, there is a SODIMM expansion that I'd be happy to use on its own, just don't know how to set the system to not use the built in RAM.
2018-06-14 10:48:09	xeodeuk	I have seen other cases where you can unsolder a certain chip and it effectively renders it broken and not initialised, but I've got no idea where to start.  The thing is effectively unusable in its current state so am now looking to resort to *hammer* level fixes : D

2018-06-14 20:55:55	KJD7	actually going slower

2018-06-14 20:57:11	KJD7	im just saying idk if it relates but when it was low disc usage it went really fast then it shot up and its going slower
2018-06-14 20:57:32	KJD7	like its 80% done first 50 took barley a minute probably

2018-06-14 21:43:38	@PipeItToDevNull	Choosing normal boot, restored all the ticks to on 
2018-06-14 21:43:46	@PipeItToDevNull	Your issue, is one of those tick boxes 
2018-06-14 21:44:04	@PipeItToDevNull	You use the process of elimination to figure out which being on, is the issue 
2018-06-14 21:44:09	KJD7	but
2018-06-14 21:44:21	KJD7	i dont know how those games have run on my normal system becase i dont play them
2018-06-14 21:44:34	@PipeItToDevNull	Steam did not run, because the Steam Client Service, was shut off
2018-06-14 21:44:43	KJD7	it was not

2018-06-14 21:45:11	@PipeItToDevNull	You can also, reinstall and run steam on a bare install 
2018-06-14 21:45:19	KJD7	i looked at boxes it was a bunch of anti cheat software and then adobe stuff and then this thing i didnt know
2018-06-14 21:45:21	KJD7	nothing from valve or steam
2018-06-14 21:45:22	@PipeItToDevNull	Keep track of what you install to know when the issue arises

2018-06-14 21:46:17	@DoctorDick	Just reinstall Windows
2018-06-14 21:46:20	@PipeItToDevNull	that needs a better explanation, disable set automatically and it should become available 
2018-06-14 21:46:22	@DoctorDick	And go from there
2018-06-14 21:46:34	KJD7	ive done that
2018-06-14 21:46:41	KJD7	ive reinstalled windows twice
2018-06-14 21:46:50	@PipeItToDevNull	And installed shit ontop of it 
2018-06-14 21:46:50	KJD7	and ive tried that with the clock
2018-06-14 21:46:52	@PipeItToDevNull	Which is the issue

2018-06-14 21:49:45	KJD7	ok so are games im confused

2018-06-14 21:51:45	@PipeItToDevNull	You turn shit on from there, and see where your issue is 
2018-06-14 21:52:06	ticksupport	Chinesium: is that really less risky than unplugging it?
2018-06-14 21:52:24	Chinesium	ticksupport: Shutting your system down? Of course that's safer
2018-06-14 21:53:13	ticksupport	Chinesium: okay, if you say so. but why is this happening? the data transfer completed over an hour ago
2018-06-14 21:53:25	@PipeItToDevNull	Cause windows sucks with eject 
2018-06-14 21:53:30	@PipeItToDevNull	it always has 
2018-06-14 21:53:43	@PipeItToDevNull	As long as the write is done, it doesnt really matter 
2018-06-14 21:53:50	KJD7	thing is like idek if i rebooted coorectly
2018-06-14 21:54:02	@PipeItToDevNull	The issue is a cache of data that is held to be written

2018-06-14 22:15:41	KJD7	once i find out what program is causing the issue what do i do
2018-06-14 22:15:56	KJD7	i just diabled all the adobe stuff to see what would happen
2018-06-14 22:16:43	@PipeItToDevNull	uninstall, or leave it disabled and see if there are any ill-effects 
2018-06-14 22:20:31	KJD7	from now on do i disable and enable in normal mode
2018-06-14 22:21:10	KJD7	disabled all but one adobe and still have 100%disk usage
2018-06-14 22:21:49	@PipeItToDevNull	normal mode and selective are not really important 
2018-06-14 22:21:59	@PipeItToDevNull	They reflect what is checked 
2018-06-14 22:22:50	KJD7	well it feels even slower than normal
2018-06-14 22:23:13	KJD7	it for sure is slower
2018-06-14 22:24:45	@PipeItToDevNull	Eliminate processes, all of those are what need to be gone through 
2018-06-14 22:25:10	KJD7	some are vital to what i do like steam so what if something vital is the issue
2018-06-14 22:25:22	@PipeItToDevNull	Reinstall it 
2018-06-14 22:25:44	@PipeItToDevNull	Or pursue that as a new line in google

2018-06-15 11:41:39	HakubaX	Ah
2018-06-15 11:42:14	X230t	I.e. If your laptop has an intake on the bottom, get a fan that blows upwards

2018-06-15 20:56:21	isuc	I looked on pc part picker says it will fit, but it won't. It clips into the PCI-E clip but wont set all the way into the socket. It seems as if the Silver Guard on the ports is too short.

2018-06-15 21:01:31	colt	So it most likely is the PSU... these hard drives im using are from my old build they should be fine. The GPU is brand new EVGA 1070 GTX SC

2018-06-15 21:02:31	@whitewolf	isuc: your motherboard is likely improperly installed, it's not close enough to the I/O plate

2018-06-15 21:05:04	isuc	what is the I/O plate?
2018-06-15 21:05:38	isuc	Also, I had a 960 in there before and it fit, maybe that doesnt have anything to do with it but just other info maybe helpful?

2018-06-15 21:07:17	@DoctorDick	That's an I/O plate
2018-06-15 21:07:51	isuc	And thats the one on my case or my video card? im so sorry for being a newb
2018-06-15 21:08:02	@DoctorDick	isuc, On your case
2018-06-15 21:08:13	@DoctorDick	The first picture shows a gap between your mobo and the I/O case
2018-06-15 21:11:55	isuc	Thats the video card that is hanging away from the case in the first picture, I hadnt put the screws onto it just yet. If thats what you mean.

2018-06-15 21:13:19	isuc	I also don't have an I/O plate on the mobo
2018-06-15 21:13:33	@whitewolf	uhm you surely do
2018-06-15 21:13:40	@whitewolf	unless your ports are just hanging out
2018-06-15 21:13:41	@Mikeee	the i/o plate gets attached to the case
2018-06-15 21:13:46	@Mikeee	its specific to the mobo
2018-06-15 21:14:02	isuc	Right, I dont have that plate. Theres nothing there.
2018-06-15 21:14:09	@Mikeee	and comes with the motherboard when purchased
2018-06-15 21:14:13	isuc	THe silver plate that you attach to where the ports are.
2018-06-15 21:14:16	@whitewolf	nice, you didn't install it
2018-06-15 21:14:20	@whitewolf	so it goes
2018-06-15 21:14:21	@DoctorDick	lol wtf
2018-06-15 21:14:23	isuc	It was a prebuilt system
2018-06-15 21:14:28	@DoctorDick	wat
2018-06-15 21:14:30	@whitewolf	so you just have a gaping hole where your ports are
2018-06-15 21:14:31	isuc	Moved from the other case.
2018-06-15 21:14:35	isuc	Correct.
2018-06-15 21:14:35	@whitewolf	ah
2018-06-15 21:14:39	@whitewolf	you didn't move the i/o plate
2018-06-15 21:14:40	isuc	Never gave an issue before
2018-06-15 21:14:46	@whitewolf	is this not an ATX board?
2018-06-15 21:14:57	isuc	GA-H81M-H
2018-06-15 21:14:57	@DoctorDick	It is
2018-06-15 21:14:59	isuc	is the motherboard.
2018-06-15 21:15:25	isuc	I dont knpow where the IO plate went
2018-06-15 21:15:31	isuc	Its not my computer, its my brothers.
2018-06-15 21:15:56	isuc	I dont know what he did with that. But out of curiosity how would that determine whether or not the Video card fits correctly?
2018-06-15 21:16:13	@DoctorDick	isuc, You need to stop smoking around that PC
2018-06-15 21:16:14	isuc	It basically clips in on the far side of the PCI-E port, but it doesnt want to sit all the way in.
2018-06-15 21:16:45	isuc	Again lol its not mine, its my brothers, he's in the other room.
2018-06-15 21:16:53	@DoctorDick	Does he smoke around it?
2018-06-15 21:17:00	isuc	Probably
2018-06-15 21:17:03	isuc	Ill tell him to stop.
2018-06-15 21:17:07	isuc	Wont do any good.
2018-06-15 21:17:09	@DoctorDick	Because that CPU heatsink is getting clogged with tar and dust
2018-06-15 21:17:39	isuc	Ill tell him why as well
2018-06-15 21:17:46	isuc	I noticed that build up on mine when I smoked too
2018-06-15 21:17:54	isuc	But, again, its not mine. Its his lol.
2018-06-15 21:17:56	@DoctorDick	I can't even right now
2018-06-15 21:18:14	isuc	XD
2018-06-15 21:23:49	@whitewolf	switch to weed
2018-06-15 21:23:52	@whitewolf	it doesn't build up the same way
2018-06-15 21:25:17	isuc	Okay look, I appreciate the concerns lmfao but again, its not my computer, it is my brothers computer. Also, can't smoke weed due to jobs. Anyway, do you think there is any chance of this thing fitting into the case?
2018-06-15 21:27:53	@whitewolf	for sure
2018-06-15 21:28:01	@whitewolf	you'll likely need to bend the shitty rosewell case if you don't want to recase it
2018-06-15 21:28:08	isuc	Oof
2018-06-15 21:28:11	@whitewolf	once you have the back of the 1080 flush with the case the connectors will sit in properly
2018-06-15 21:28:25	isuc	Yeah i took that silver guard for the ports of the 1080 off
2018-06-15 21:28:27	isuc	and it sat just fine
2018-06-15 21:28:34	isuc	but i couldnt get it sit level obviously.
2018-06-15 21:28:57	@whitewolf	aligning it properly with the i/o plate would have fixed this ;)
2018-06-15 21:29:11	isuc	Found the I/O by the wayt
2018-06-15 21:29:14	isuc	its on the old case
2018-06-15 21:29:26	@whitewolf	well, the proper way to fix this is to rebuild the machine in the case again
2018-06-15 21:29:32	@whitewolf	making sure you're actually flush with the parts that should be
2018-06-15 21:32:09	isuc	That would make sense.
2018-06-15 21:32:15	isuc	thats basically where we are at
2018-06-15 21:32:23	@whitewolf	yup
2018-06-15 21:32:33	@whitewolf	or you can say fuck you to the cheap rosewill case
2018-06-15 21:32:37	@whitewolf	and bend that fucker
2018-06-15 21:32:44	isuc	Bend which part
2018-06-15 21:32:47	isuc	Because
2018-06-15 21:32:49	isuc	We may have already
2018-06-15 21:32:53	isuc	started upon the bending.
2018-06-15 21:32:55	@whitewolf	lol
2018-06-15 21:32:57	isuc	;)
2018-06-15 21:33:05	@whitewolf	the area near the expansion cards is your problem
2018-06-15 21:33:10	@whitewolf	the motherboard is sitting too far back
2018-06-15 21:33:17	isuc	That i/o plate
2018-06-15 21:33:20	isuc	sits on it fine
2018-06-15 21:33:25	isuc	just a heads up
2018-06-15 21:33:38	@whitewolf	you shouldn't have been able to install the I/O plate with the motherboard installed.
2018-06-15 21:33:44	isuc	correct
2018-06-15 21:33:45	isuc	lol
2018-06-15 21:33:53	isuc	alreaady in the process of taking the thing out
2018-06-15 21:34:24	isuc	While you were concerned about smoking cigarettes and what not I was taking the thing apart lol

2018-06-15 21:35:46	@whitewolf	*tokes up and blows it into his fans*
2018-06-15 21:38:24	colt	So why does my BIOS come up with my GPU & SATA disconnected but not with my GPU connected? Is it my PSU or my GPU?
2018-06-15 21:38:48	@whitewolf	the GPU almost certainly if your machine stops booting once you've installed it
2018-06-15 21:38:58	@whitewolf	unless someone here already told you that you have a PSU problem
2018-06-15 21:39:04	@whitewolf	i haven't been paying attentionto you
2018-06-15 21:39:05	isuc	better not smoke cigarettes
2018-06-15 21:39:08	@PipeItToDevNull	It didnt boot without GPU 
2018-06-15 21:39:13	@PipeItToDevNull	He had to remove SATA as well

2018-06-15 22:05:34	Squeezit	I have a newly built computer with a Gigabyte z370 motherboard that has onboard bluetooth. I am trying to connect my brand new xbox one s controller to this computer wirelessly.  The computer rarely finds the controller after several attempts. On the extremely rare occasion it does find the controller, it says "Failed to connect, try again".  Micro
2018-06-15 22:05:34	Squeezit	soft support has given me no assistance with this issue and Gigabyte support is always closed when I'm not at work. I'm turning to you guys hoping you can help :(
2018-06-15 22:06:14	@PipeItToDevNull	Does it have antennas for that bluetooth card 
2018-06-15 22:06:24	Squeezit	Nope. Its just part of the motherboard
2018-06-15 22:06:30	@Mikeee	did you manually install the bluetooth driver directly from the motherboard manufacturer's website
2018-06-15 22:06:40	@PipeItToDevNull	Well, then you are trying to produce signal, inside of a metal box 
2018-06-15 22:06:48	Squeezit	I did through their gigabyte App service
2018-06-15 22:06:58	@Mikeee	manually install the bluetooth driver directly from the motherboard manufacturer's website

2018-06-15 22:13:12	@Mikeee	like all devices nowadays, the manual is online.
2018-06-15 22:13:21	@Mikeee	has been that way for about 15 years
2018-06-15 22:13:34	Squeezit	Just downloaded, I'll review it and see if I can find which of these extra cords might be the antenna
2018-06-15 22:13:55	Squeezit	Sorry, this is the first computer I've built in roughly 10 years.  Last motherboard didn't really give me any trouble
2018-06-15 22:15:25	Squeezit	so Ctrl+F on the manual and searching the word bluetooth only gives me some quick information that bluetooth exists. I'm still looking at the guide, but thought I'd mention that real quick
2018-06-15 22:15:36	@DoctorDick	The most current version is 20.60.0.4
2018-06-15 22:16:39	Squeezit	Thanks Doctor, I downloaded that version directly from Intel.  I think Mikeee might be right that my issue is the missing antenna. I found a couple things tha tlook like they might be my antenna, just trying to find if I'm looking at hte right thing in the manual (unfortunately the manual isn't being very helpful)
2018-06-15 22:19:39	Squeezit	Alright, I'm sorry I'm really struggling to find anything about a bluetooth antenna in this manual anywhere. I've also looked at all the left over parts.  The only thing that looks like it might be it, is a P/N: 12CF1-1TM001-01R  which I have 2 of in the box still. But a quick google shows me one othe rguy who tried to look it up and said he thinks
2018-06-15 22:19:40	Squeezit	 its for the temperature or something

2018-06-16 00:52:23	idlywildly	why is that? won't they need the main file itself? I read VLC media player doesn't store any cookies of the like, if I played a VLC video and that video file is from another drive, I take it off, clear the storage- how is that possible when I can't even play it bakc?
2018-06-16 00:52:47	@DoctorDick	What?
2018-06-16 00:52:55	idlywildly	I only installed VLC, paid bills, edited photos/videos but using portable apps
2018-06-16 00:54:04	idlywildly	I have an external drive. I plug it in. I installed VLC, I played the videos from the external drive using VLC. Are they still recoverable? Even photos I've edited without dragging them into the main SDD that I want to clear?
2018-06-16 00:54:15	@DoctorDick	You installed VLC where?
2018-06-16 00:54:18	idlywildly	the videos/photos are in an external drive
2018-06-16 00:54:20	@DoctorDick	On the external?
2018-06-16 00:54:25	@DoctorDick	Or on your computer?
2018-06-16 00:54:35	idlywildly	in the main SSD that I want to clear
2018-06-16 00:54:57	@DoctorDick	The only files that are retrievable on your external drive are those files are you've actually put on there
2018-06-16 00:55:30	idlywildly	but are they retrievable from the main SSD that I want to clear?
2018-06-16 00:56:23	@DoctorDick	No, why would you think that?
2018-06-16 00:56:28	idlywildly	actually, I installed VLC in my secondary HDD- Then I played films from an external/portable drive + edited photos. Nothing was dragged into the main SSD (the one I want to clean/clear)
2018-06-16 00:56:46	idlywildly	I've been getting mixed answers from my research
2018-06-16 00:56:50	@DoctorDick	The only files that are recoverable from a certain drive are those files that are ON that drive
2018-06-16 00:56:58	@DoctorDick	What kind of retards are you asking?
2018-06-16 00:57:09	idlywildly	(some people in the sub)
2018-06-16 00:57:29	idlywildly	but somehow it's still possible, probably on a higher super higher level though
2018-06-16 00:57:54	idlywildly	ALSO last question, since I paid my bills but I only used incognito (chrome) in that SSD. Are they somewhat still recoverable...?
2018-06-16 00:58:10	@DoctorDick	??
2018-06-16 00:58:13	@DoctorDick	Not possible
2018-06-16 00:58:19	idlywildly	okay
2018-06-16 00:58:26	@DoctorDick	Unless somehow your drive is breaking the laws of physics
2018-06-16 00:59:25	idlywildly	some guy just mentioned that a "write" in any storage device, is a write itself. The way it was described was in a storage device, there are blocks, when those blocks are used BUT the info. in them are deleted, the blocks have been permanently changed
2018-06-16 00:59:36	idlywildly	so any file can still be somewhat recoverable, if that makes sense
2018-06-16 00:59:57	@DoctorDick	What the fuck are you talking about
2018-06-16 01:00:19	@DoctorDick	That is only applicable to the drive the file was on
2018-06-16 01:00:38	@DoctorDick	Just write 0's to the drive if it's a HDD
2018-06-16 01:00:42	@DoctorDick	Using DBAN
2018-06-16 01:00:48	idlywildly	I make another example, you have an SSD. You clear/clean the SSD fresh wiped. Everything is cleared HOWEVER the space you used have been used and can still show up as used
2018-06-16 01:00:57	idlywildly	DBAN works on SSDs?
2018-06-16 01:01:05	idlywildly	I'll try
2018-06-16 01:01:13	@DoctorDick	Do not use DBAN for SSDs
2018-06-16 01:01:15	idlywildly	so I'll plug in the SSD I'm to sell, just use DBAN, and clear?
2018-06-16 01:01:18	idlywildly	oh

2018-06-16 11:04:18	daerisdir	So I recentely bought a bluetooth dongle (CN-516) for my PC to connect my Dualshock 4 controller to it.

They only do this whenever the controller is connecte
2018-06-16 11:04:18	daerisdir	d to the driver software of my bluetooth dongle. If I disconnect the controller they just keep searching. My Windows version is Windows 10. Can anyone help me out?

2018-06-16 15:25:55	Joe_Q	Folks. I've been in here a few times over the last week or so. At my wits' end trying to keep my CPU cool. I just bought a brand new cooler and new thermal paste, installed them according to directions and I am still hitting 80C CPU package temp within 20-30 sec of bootup.

2018-06-16 15:30:14	Joe_Q	How this whole thing started is that I was experiencing random system reboots, my first thought was to replace the PSU which I did, but that didn't solve them; came in here, the crowd advised replacing thermal paste (it had been 3-4 years) which I did, but temps did not come down; crowd then advised replacing cooler
2018-06-16 15:30:20	Joe_Q	Which I've just done -- but temps are high

2018-06-16 16:28:24	Joe_Q	Right
2018-06-16 16:28:25	@DoctorDick	Since you've been running it at 99C for 4 years straight
2018-06-16 16:28:31	@DoctorDick	It could be the TIM needs to be replaced
2018-06-16 16:28:39	Joe_Q	TIM = thermal grease/
2018-06-16 16:28:41	Joe_Q	?
2018-06-16 16:28:51	@electricbear	yes
2018-06-16 16:29:11	Joe_Q	That was the initial suggestion -- I replaced the thermal grease several times already but no luck
2018-06-16 16:29:13	@DoctorDick	Except it goes between the IHS and the actual silicon
2018-06-16 16:29:37	Joe_Q	Ah, so "underneath" the CPU? between it and its socket?

2018-06-16 16:30:01	@DoctorDick	TIM is different than the thermal compound that goes between your IHS and the heatsink
2018-06-16 16:30:03	@Mikeee	between the aluminum "shield" on it and the processor inside
2018-06-16 16:30:55	@Mikeee	the internal paste can damage since its not made to run at such high temps (usually people notice and fix problems within days, not years)
2018-06-16 16:31:39	Niveo	Hello. I was wondering something about information storage, I don't really get how this works. Let's say I develop and launch an app, and a user register on my app. 4 months later that person deletes their account. Will I as a host also lose all the information from that user?
2018-06-16 16:32:12	Joe_Q	I don't know what to tell you... problems only popped up a couple months ago and extremely sporadic
2018-06-16 16:32:19	@DoctorDick	Niveo, Depends on your retention policy and how you've implemented deletion of users

2018-06-16 16:45:18	Joe_Q	Yes that's what I'm figuring
2018-06-16 16:45:26	@DoctorDick	Also more expensive
2018-06-16 16:45:48	@DoctorDick	I mean you could always send it to someone to get it repasted

2018-06-16 16:46:19	@DoctorDick	Yes
2018-06-16 16:46:32	@DoctorDick	But we're talking about the compound between your IHS and the silicon
2018-06-16 16:46:37	@DoctorDick	Not the IHS and the heatsink
2018-06-16 16:46:41	Joe_Q	Yes I understand that
2018-06-16 16:46:48	@Mikeee	but the issue is unlikely to be caused by application of paste, but by how you mounted the heatsink
2018-06-16 16:47:25	@Mikeee	a bad mount, a warped heatsink, a hair on the processor or even a bent processor can do it
2018-06-16 16:47:37	Joe_Q	Heatsink comes down flat on to the top of the processor housing and then gets clamped on from the back of the mobo
2018-06-16 16:47:49	@Mikeee	you don't have the equipment to know if it is flat.
2018-06-16 16:48:23	Joe_Q	I mean I am placing it flat against the top of the processor housing
2018-06-16 16:48:37	Joe_Q	You're correct, I don't know if it is completely perfectly flat
2018-06-16 16:48:54	@DoctorDick	What processor is it?
2018-06-16 16:49:18	Joe_Q	AMD A10-5800K
2018-06-16 16:49:42	@DoctorDick	Yeah I'd just upgrade at this point
2018-06-16 16:49:56	@Mikeee	maximum safe temp is 75C from what i recall
2018-06-16 16:49:58	@DoctorDick	That processor is not worth it
2018-06-16 16:50:14	Joe_Q	Yes, it was mid range when I got it in 2014
2018-06-16 16:51:08	Joe_Q	I don't need high performance. Mobo is FM2 so I guess I will look for something that (still) fits that socket
2018-06-16 16:51:34	@DoctorDick	Just upgrade the mobo and CPU
2018-06-16 16:51:42	@DoctorDick	That socket is way too old
2018-06-16 16:52:48	@DoctorDick	With DDR3, you can use anything up to 4th gen Intel and Piledriver from AMD
2018-06-16 16:53:29	@PipeItToDevNull	FX8350 would work fine 
2018-06-16 16:53:32	@PipeItToDevNull	and be cheap 
2018-06-16 16:54:53	@DoctorDick	If your RAM is DDR3L, some Skylake mobos will support that too
2018-06-16 16:54:55	@electricbear	love me some 8350
2018-06-16 16:55:52	@DoctorDick	I hate AMD
2018-06-16 17:01:23	@Mikeee	AMD was a much more ethical company than intel, had better designs, and faster processors
2018-06-16 17:02:12	@Mikeee	then intel stole their secrets by paying people to get hired at AMD and funnel them information
2018-06-16 17:02:30	@Mikeee	nobody involved went to jail and IIRC no fines were paid
2018-06-16 17:03:06	@Mikeee	but it completely ruined AMD because of the billions worth of R&D they lost overnight

2018-06-17 13:37:01	Niveo	Hi. I was talking to some guy the other day concerning browser history that's saved in my computer. I am trying to find a link I visited a few months ago, but I can't find it. I found a link I visited around a year ago, so could the link I'm looking for technicly be somewhere on my harddrive? I don't really get how cache and such work
2018-06-17 13:37:42	Niveo	I remember him telling me it gets overwritten really fast. Which is why I got surprised when I found the other link that's way older
2018-06-17 13:38:36	@PipeItToDevNull	Where did you find the link 
2018-06-17 13:39:09	Niveo	Ahh, it was you! I remember now. By doing a recovery with Recuva on my chrome folder
2018-06-17 13:39:31	@PipeItToDevNull	and what file did it say it was in 
2018-06-17 13:39:54	Niveo	Give me a second to find it, I copied everything to another drive
2018-06-17 13:40:29	Niveo	C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default
2018-06-17 13:40:52	@PipeItToDevNull	That is a directory 
2018-06-17 13:41:03	Niveo	Oh my bad. It was just a random log-file
2018-06-17 13:41:39	@PipeItToDevNull	Let me exit a match real quick 
2018-06-17 13:42:12	Niveo	I got over 900 of those files, but I've only checked like 6 so far
2018-06-17 13:42:13	Niveo	Sure
2018-06-17 13:42:44	@PipeItToDevNull	Ok, you either have a very serious issue, that you are not treating as such, or you have a mental issue that has you fixed on a lost cause to the point of self degradation. You are fighting the very function of an SSD at this point, and scrounging everything that even looks like a link. 
2018-06-17 13:43:37	@PipeItToDevNull	TRIM, removes data when it isnt needed, a professional would likely tell you it is a lost cause at this point even if you send it out 
2018-06-17 13:44:46	@PipeItToDevNull	No one here is a data recovery professional, and they would all refer you to one, you will look at spending several hundred, if not thousands of dollars to get the data back that you are seeking 
2018-06-17 13:45:09	@PipeItToDevNull	With no guarantee of success 
2018-06-17 13:46:15	@PipeItToDevNull	While I an undoubtedly an asshole, that is the truth 
2018-06-17 13:46:19	Niveo	Nono, I'm not saying you guys are. I was just wondering, if I managed to find a file that's over one year old, wouldn't it be technicly possible for me to find what I need? I don't really get how this overwriting thing works, why newer stuff gets overwritten before the old stuff
2018-06-17 13:46:51	@DoctorDick	You might have just gotten lucky
2018-06-17 13:47:02	@DoctorDick	And data has written to that area at all
2018-06-17 13:47:05	@DoctorDick	Or minimally
2018-06-17 13:48:34	Niveo	Okay, I see. Oh well, I'll continue searching through this and see what happens
2018-06-17 13:48:37	@PipeItToDevNull	Cells are not written to in sequence, it is random

2018-06-17 17:04:56	@Swede	I think you should restart again
2018-06-17 17:05:03	Mekbot	I forced the pc to shutdown because windows crashed and everything stopped working, but when I turned it back on, as soon as I clicked on taskbar the buttons stopped working, I used my keyboard to open Google Chrome and the buttons started working but only on Chrome, if i try anything else they stop
2018-06-17 17:05:25	Mekbot	Yeah I tried restarting again (Forced shutdown since i cant click anything) but same issue
2018-06-17 17:06:17	@Swede	don't force. Windowskey for the menu, tab to move button, space to click
2018-06-17 17:06:42	@Swede	possibly USB is broken. i don't know
2018-06-17 17:07:07	Mekbot	Ok will try that, I already tried disconecting the mouse and reconecting on diferent port

2018-06-17 17:25:45	Brandon	Is it possible to stop the ROG SupremeFX sound manager window from popping up every time I plug in my headphones? I have the Asus ROG Strix B350 mobo and I installed the audio drivers from Asus so I'm assuming that's where this software comes from. It's not listed in my control panel so I can't "uninstall" it the official way.

2018-06-17 18:32:49	WindowsRepair	I used a Windows Installation on a USB to view the files of that drive, but I do not know how to procede
2018-06-17 18:38:23	@Mikeee_	wipe it and install clean
2018-06-17 18:39:15	WindowsRepair	okay, guess I can backup the files and restore what I need
2018-06-17 18:40:05	WindowsRepair	but there is another Problem, I have used veracrypt to encrypt my drives, and the only one I seem to Access as of right now is the main one. So I am afraid if I wipe it clean I wont be able to acess the others. (I had an Option thta made them Mount when I log in)
2018-06-17 18:44:57	WindowsRepair	So I'd prefer to repair it somehow if possible and then to log into it
2018-06-17 18:47:29	@Mikeee_	why not just restore from the backups you already have (because nobody would be insane enough to not have backups of their important files)
2018-06-17 18:48:02	WindowsRepair	Because I would still lose some things that I sadly have no backups of
2018-06-17 18:48:20	WindowsRepair	even though they are not really important or crucial, acquiring them again might be a hassle I try to avoid
2018-06-17 18:48:58	@Mikeee_	if its a "hassle" to get them then they are important and should have been backed up
2018-06-17 18:49:47	WindowsRepair	well I guess I am insane then

2018-06-17 22:00:06	cornking	any thoughts? furmark seemed to run alright, cruised up to ~82C and stayed there
2018-06-17 22:00:21	@PipeItToDevNull	all that seems fine, what games have issues?
2018-06-17 22:00:36	cornking	rivals of aether and duck game

2018-06-17 22:01:07	@TechSupport	To cleanly uninstall your display drivers, launch DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) in safe mode and select the "Clean and Restart" option in the DDU window - https://goo.gl/KSoEbJ
2018-06-17 22:01:12	@PipeItToDevNull	You can try that 
2018-06-17 22:01:21	@PipeItToDevNull	But, I would say that is more the game at that point 
2018-06-17 22:02:47	cornking	i guess so

2018-06-17 22:30:05	cornking	nah i know

2018-06-17 22:30:44	cornking	too bad for me i guess
2018-06-17 22:30:51	cornking	thanks for your help anyway y'all
2018-06-17 22:32:29	@DoctorDick	cornking, You try a clean install?
2018-06-17 22:32:48	@DoctorDick	Completely wiping the drive and and deleting the partitions?
2018-06-17 22:33:29	cornking	no not yet
2018-06-17 22:33:37	cornking	i guess that'll be the next thing i try once i get the gear for it
2018-06-17 22:33:40	@DoctorDick	I'd do that to eliminate all software issues
2018-06-17 22:34:25	cornking	i did the windows OS reset thing where it deletes everything but your "personal files"
2018-06-17 22:34:39	cornking	i guess the problem could still lie therein tho and not in whatever windows deletes and replaces thru that process
2018-06-17 22:34:47	cornking	can't imagine what it would be tho
2018-06-17 22:34:58	@DoctorDick	cornking, Oh that's not a clean install
2018-06-17 22:35:17	@DoctorDick	It's like repainting the outside of your house
2018-06-17 22:35:22	@DoctorDick	The old paint is still there
2018-06-17 22:35:31	cornking	what does it actually do?
2018-06-17 22:35:49	@DoctorDick	Remove all programs
2018-06-17 22:36:03	@DoctorDick	I'd recommend you create a Windows 10 flash drive
2018-06-17 22:36:09	@DoctorDick	And actually do a clean install
2018-06-17 22:36:20	@DoctorDick	You can do that by choosing "Custom" and deleting all partitions

2018-06-18 11:03:41	Zol	Hello. I am having issues with mics working on my laptop since the windows 10 update in April. The onboard mic does not work and I tried plugging in a different mic and it did not work either. I have reinstalled the driver and made sure that I have the mic settings are set to allow the use of a mic by all apps. Sadly these steps did not help the is
2018-06-18 11:03:41	Zol	sue. The mic has worked for 30-45 seconds before it stopped working again.

2018-06-18 11:05:05	Zol	I forgot to say the mic worked for 30-45 seconds after reinstalling the driver then stopped. I do apologize for not completing that thought.

2018-06-18 11:57:46	Solution	Shoot, wasn't done typing - anyways; it's a windows 10 machine with a GTX770, I've uninstalled any and all graphics drivers before clean installing the latest one from the website of the manufacturer. I get a little lost in eventviewer at times but I can't seem to find the cause. By softlock I mean everything becomes unresponsive, but my screen is 
2018-06-18 11:57:47	Solution	still refreshing because mouse movents show up. Hardlock is basically extremely stuttery audio and 0 responsiveness with a frozen screen.

2018-06-18 12:02:23	Solution	I have, bitdefender came up empty - I tried malwarebytes as well and both tell me it's clean. I'll take a look at tronscript!

2018-06-18 12:14:03	qak	@ProBro if it's new, you'll need to initialize it first. GPT is if you want to install via UEFI and MBR would now be considered legacy
2018-06-18 12:14:39	qak	I usually don't bother initializing though as installing W10 through a USB does it automatically for you. Just make sure to boot the USB in UEFI if possible

2018-06-18 14:14:36	pkgear	Could someone help me with a computer issue I'm having?
2018-06-18 14:14:53	@Mikeee_	pkgear:  please read the rules at the top
2018-06-18 14:16:07	pkgear	My desktop's hard drive (the one with windows installed on it) was not working and most likely corrupted. If I replaced the windows hard drive with another one, do I need to install a whole new windows cdkey?

2018-06-18 14:16:36	pkgear	Or could I just replace that hard drive with a new one and reinstall windows without a new cdkey (I'm asking because I lost my CD Key)
2018-06-18 14:16:41	stefagta	yes
2018-06-18 14:16:57	stefagta	if you remove your old hard drive you need to reinstall it cuz the windows is on that hard drive
2018-06-18 14:17:01	stefagta	try defragmenting it
2018-06-18 14:17:02	Nevercouldpickan	My wifi is choppy even when I am in the same room as the modem but the internet speed is fine when i use a cable

2018-06-18 14:18:02	@Mikeee_	pkgear:  if it's windows 8 or above, your key is tied to the motherboard. It should activate when you install windows to the new drive
2018-06-18 14:18:29	@Mikeee_	if it does not within a decent time period, come back and we'll try to help recover the key from the bad drive
2018-06-18 14:19:10	stefagta	go to file explorer- right click on your drive-properties-tools tab-optimize

2018-06-18 14:21:30	pkgear	I made a copy of the files that I needed and put it on my external where I keep my back up files
2018-06-18 14:21:42	pkgear	What do you mean?
2018-06-18 14:22:03	@Mikeee_	unless you imaged it to the external, it wouldn't be bootable

2018-06-18 14:22:51	@Mikeee_	i would suggest clean installing windows to the drive with the potential problems
2018-06-18 14:24:01	pkgear	How do you clean install

2018-06-18 15:26:03	qak	@Mikeee_ it was recommended by our tech at the time. We have a business with over 12 people working on the file at a time. Also RDP is quite handy for remote users ,though not an optimal solution

2018-06-18 15:40:38	qak	Solution: Would you try reseating the ram in different slots and maybe testing it 1 stick at a time? also, just reseat the graphics card in case
2018-06-18 15:41:15	qak	I'd also try checking in your bios to see how much memory shows up in there with all sticks in just to see if it's correct

I dualbooted my PC into Ubuntu and Windows and neither worked.  I tried a clean reinstall of Windows, which works for a bit but my PC suddenly restarts (goes into black screen) within 10 minutes and the i

2018-06-19 11:50:05	TouhouProject	Thanks for your help
2018-06-19 11:50:59	TouhouProject	When I say my PC is unbootable, I mean that my PC gets to the Windows 10 loading screen before suddenly stopping and restarting, this happens several times and I am eventually able to get into diagnostics, which allows me to start via safe mode

2018-06-19 13:59:59	slimy	what do you see there?

2018-06-19 14:00:27	Snowvaan	2 close
2018-06-19 14:00:38	Snowvaan	1 is the speaker
2018-06-19 14:00:40	slimy	try disabling the one you dont use then restart fallout
2018-06-19 14:00:47	slimy	so the only enabled option is your speaker
2018-06-19 14:00:48	Snowvaan	and the other is the name of the monitor Acer V246HQL
2018-06-19 14:01:11	slimy	disable the monitor's speakers.  i bet it has internal ones that are borked
2018-06-19 14:01:27	slimy	you can right click it and select 'disable'
2018-06-19 14:01:49	slimy	so the only enabled options should now be your speakers.  restart fallout as changes won't happen until it's restarted with new settings

2018-06-19 14:52:12	@Swede	4 keyboards, 2 mice, 2 hubs?
2018-06-19 14:52:49	Twak	No idea what that means I have just a razer keyboard plugged in and a mouse
2018-06-19 14:53:02	Twak	So three usbs in total
2018-06-19 14:53:10	@Swede	unplug both. Does it still shut down?
2018-06-19 14:53:17	Twak	Yes
2018-06-19 14:53:25	@Donjuanal	did you buy these parts used?
2018-06-19 14:53:38	Twak	No new from amazon
2018-06-19 14:54:13	@Swede	When mounting the mainboard, there's standoffs under it. If one standoff exists where there is no screw hole, you made a short circuit
2018-06-19 14:54:53	Twak	And is that making this issue?
2018-06-19 14:55:00	@Donjuanal	also, check to make sure your I/O Shield isn't actually inside the usb slots
2018-06-19 14:55:05	@Swede	you have an usb power issue. Serious
2018-06-19 14:55:33	Twak	Okay is there anything I can do about this?
2018-06-19 14:55:47	@Donjuanal	yes, youve been given two things to check
2018-06-19 14:55:55	@Donjuanal	?breadboard
2018-06-19 14:55:56	@TechSupport	Breadboarding is rebuilding the entire computer outside the case on a table or a wooden breadboard, this should leave you with ONLY the PSU, RAM, CPU w/ heatsink, GPU (Only if you don't have integrated graphics) and motherboard.
2018-06-19 14:55:59	@Swede	check the io shield. Take the board out, connect it on a table, test it
2018-06-19 14:56:31	Twak	Will do
2018-06-19 14:56:42	@Swede	check where EVERY standoff goes
2018-06-19 14:56:47	slimy	godspeed
2018-06-19 14:59:25	slimy	i got a spare budget build recently and i noticed that it doesnt recognize usb devices if they are plugged in when on
2018-06-19 14:59:48	slimy	though when i reboot with it in it recognizes it fine
2018-06-19 14:59:54	slimy	anyone got an idea on that?
2018-06-19 15:00:21	@Swede	there's often a bios setting about PNP/plug and play os. Toggle it
2018-06-19 15:00:33	@Swede	or maybe that was 10 years ago lol
2018-06-19 15:01:03	slimy	i didn't breadboard it so your message reminded me i should give that a shot
2018-06-19 15:01:19	slimy	wondering if i fucked something up when i installed the mobo
2018-06-19 15:01:37	Twak	Quick question what should my usb pin connector be connected to, usb56 usb910 or usb1112?
2018-06-19 15:02:09	@Swede	that probably means "usb 5 and 6", usb 9 and 10
2018-06-19 15:02:17	@Swede	Doesn't matter

2018-06-19 21:28:34	zbee	Sure sure. So what I should do instead is just get more adapters for the monitors I'm getting so I can put it back in crossfire mode?

2018-06-19 21:34:41	@desgen	zbee, explain crossfire to me, how do you enable/disable it, and what conditions must it be in to have it working
2018-06-19 21:35:32	zbee	USB HDDs are unplugged. When I disable it: unplug crossfire cable from both cards. Enable: plug cable back in, hop in radeon settings and make sure crossfire mode is turned back on globally and for my specific games
2018-06-19 21:36:08	@desgen	and what conditions must it be in to have it working
2018-06-19 21:36:37	zbee	Ummm I have to make sure crossfire mode is actually enabled and whatnot, and I have to figure out what crossfire mode it should be in for which games
2018-06-19 21:36:52	zbee	I'm not sure what you're looking for rn
2018-06-19 21:37:05	@desgen	why must crossfire be disabled right now for the monitors to work again?
2018-06-19 21:37:15	@desgen	the ports, right?
2018-06-19 21:37:20	@desgen	lacking them, even
2018-06-19 21:37:29	zbee	with the 3 monitors I'm currently running it doesn't need to be disabled
2018-06-19 21:37:45	@desgen	so why is it off right now, I assume it is
2018-06-19 21:38:12	zbee	Because my 3rd monitor wasn't working and I tried that before I made windows stop disabling the 3rd monitor for no reason
2018-06-19 21:38:24	@desgen	mk
2018-06-19 21:38:34	@desgen	so we have a solution we're going to try

2018-06-20 15:26:55	Toco	the motherboard

2018-06-20 15:28:29	slimy	or did the repair people give it a clean install?
2018-06-20 15:28:41	Toco	I had to do it myself
2018-06-20 15:28:51	Greenswe	Trying to unscrew the thing holding the cooler (antec kuhler h20 620) to the cpu, but one of the screws isn't going up no matter how much I turn it
2018-06-20 15:29:22	Toco	I reset it because I thought the lag was caused by some sort of malware

2018-06-20 15:29:31	Toco	but it continued after the reset

2018-06-22 19:39:15	frex	No the headphones still dont work, when I plugged it in (I was listening to a video for test) and it made a large static noise for a few seconds
2018-06-22 19:39:20	cheesefdsafsa	hiss
2018-06-22 19:39:21	cheesefdsafsa	low pitched
2018-06-22 19:39:44	cheesefdsafsa	mid pitched actually
2018-06-22 19:39:55	cheesefdsafsa	its extremely irritating
2018-06-22 19:40:10	@Eisenstein	cheesefdsafsa: unfortunately that is probably interference from a voltage line either neat the sound output or on the motherboard
2018-06-22 19:40:48	@Eisenstein	you can get a USB dac for less than $20 which should prbably fix the issue

2018-06-22 19:57:52	frex	Nope there isnt one of those I checked, when I do an online microphone test on the browser it shows it works, but when I use software on my pc (skype, discord etc) it doesn't recognize my microphone.
2018-06-22 19:58:22	SamB	I've tried multiple data recovery apps but the card doesn't stay connected long enough for them to read it. I've tried it on two computers and it's from a phone and the phone reads it as corrupted.
2018-06-22 19:58:23	@Eisenstein	frex: does it show up in device manager?
2018-06-22 19:58:32	SamB	The only option is to reset the SD card on the phone

2018-06-23 12:13:21	Zourak	I did
2018-06-23 12:13:35	Zourak	I cant eleminate further then CPU and Mainboard
2018-06-23 12:13:53	@Eisenstein	well, that suggests it is either the cpu or the mainboard
2018-06-23 12:14:10	Zourak	yes, and thats why I'm gonna return both and demand new ones
2018-06-23 12:14:39	@Eisenstein	you dont have to demand anything, just return it and be nice
2018-06-23 12:15:17	@DoctorDick	Zourak, I'd exchange the mobo first
2018-06-23 12:15:26	@Eisenstein	when working techsupport you are always at the bad end of someone's bad day
2018-06-23 12:15:36	@Eisenstein	they really appreciate it when you are nice to them
2018-06-23 12:15:57	Zourak	I bought it online so I have to wait for shipping etc. I dont wanna end up with a new motherboard and then having to send in the CPU bc its faulty too
2018-06-23 12:16:08	@Eisenstein	hence why I try to interject humour and random other things
2018-06-23 12:16:19	@Eisenstein	it helps alleviate the mood
2018-06-23 12:16:31	@Eisenstein	Zourak: CPUs very rarely go bad
2018-06-23 12:17:02	@DoctorDick	Zourak, I mean you could always go to a repair shop and have them test your components
2018-06-23 12:17:16	@Eisenstein	in fact, unless I have actually seen smoke come out of one, I have never seen a CPU that was bad
2018-06-23 12:17:30	@DoctorDick	Or if you have friends with compatible parts you could ask them
2018-06-23 12:17:32	Zourak	my nearest PC shop still has GPUs from 2007 and Windows XP on display
2018-06-23 12:17:42	@Eisenstein	Zourak: what's wrong with that?
2018-06-23 12:18:02	Zourak	it sums up how up to date they are
2018-06-23 12:18:21	@Eisenstein	they can't afford new inventory, it doesnt mean they don't know how to fix things
2018-06-23 12:18:47	Zourak	They would need an 8th gen Intel board as well to test and I dont thing they have one
2018-06-23 12:19:27	@Eisenstein	I am sure they have a shelf full of known good parts, they just can't keep stocking new gen stuff that doesn't sell
2018-06-23 12:19:42	@Eisenstein	but I am just guessing

2018-06-23 12:21:37	Zourak	yes, currently the mainboard only has the 2x4 and the 2x idk connected

2018-06-23 12:25:16	@DoctorDick	They have LED codes now
2018-06-23 12:25:42	@Eisenstein	Zourak: it means that the monitor is getting a signal but can't use it
2018-06-23 12:26:00	causasui	woke up this morning and my laptop is doing this: http://upload.fopedush.com/malathion/laptopmonitor.jpg i've built many desktop PCs over 15+ years but I never really did hardware work on a laptop beyond replacing a hard disk or RAM. the laptop is pretty old but I'm in between jobs and would rather salveage it if possible. can anyone tell me what to expect or where to go to learn how to troubleshoot this?
2018-06-23 12:26:07	@DoctorDick	Zourak, Do you have a GPU plugged in?

2018-06-23 12:26:48	@Eisenstein	you can try and do a panel swap

2018-06-23 12:26:56	@Eisenstein	you can fix it

2018-06-23 12:27:49	causasui	ok, do I need one specific to this make and model laptop or is it a generic part?
2018-06-23 12:27:56	Zourak	does that mean there is hope or is that just another indication that something is broken? "the monitor is getting a signal but cant use it"

2018-06-23 12:28:22	Zahand	I need some help.
2018-06-23 12:28:29	@Eisenstein	a dell laptop of that generation probably uses the same panel as apple laptops and others, it should be a part you can get salavage
2018-06-23 12:29:03	@Eisenstein	is this 15" or 17"?
2018-06-23 12:29:11	causasui	15
2018-06-23 12:29:11	Zahand	I was installing Corsair Utility Engine and got bluescreen. My computer restarted and got another bluescreen. Now I can't even boot into windows. Everytime I try I get a new bluscreen and I get a "Windows Repair Tool"
2018-06-23 12:29:20	Zahand	but it can't fix the problem
2018-06-23 12:29:27	@Eisenstein	15", what is the resolution?
2018-06-23 12:29:43	@Eisenstein	Zahand: run the windows repair tool

2018-06-23 12:30:03	Zahand	it does it by itself when I boot, but it says it fails

2018-06-23 12:30:53	@Eisenstein	well, take it apart and take the panel out, google the part number it should be written on a label on the back
2018-06-23 12:31:01	@Eisenstein	replacing the screen doofus
2018-06-23 12:31:18	@Eisenstein	i would bet it is an LG or samsung panel
2018-06-23 12:31:26	@Eisenstein	probably a generic swap for many laptops
2018-06-23 12:31:35	causasui	I thought we only have to potentially replace the LVDS board and/or cable, not the entire panel?
2018-06-23 12:31:44	@Eisenstein	might as well replace the whole panel
2018-06-23 12:31:55	@Eisenstein	it is the same price and it is easier
2018-06-23 12:31:55	causasui	money and time are a concern tho
2018-06-23 12:32:03	causasui	alright, that's an argument I can accept
2018-06-23 12:32:30	causasui	so you're saying I can get a new panel with lvds board&cable for the same price as board&cable alone?
2018-06-23 12:32:39	@DoctorDick	You should see if that also happens on an external monitor
2018-06-23 12:32:55	@DoctorDick	or TV
2018-06-23 12:33:21	@DoctorDick	You can always just connect that laptop to the external monitor/TV and not spend any money
2018-06-23 12:33:47	causasui	DoctorDick: I need it to be portable, I have a desktop PC for working at home
2018-06-23 12:33:58	causasui	but I will try to hook it up to a monitor
2018-06-23 12:36:00	@desgen	Zourak, keep trying until you conclude something is broken
2018-06-23 12:36:02	@Eisenstein	causasui: generally you get the panel from a broken laptop with a working panel, so yes, it would be just as cheap
2018-06-23 12:36:11	Zahand	how long should the windows "Attempting repairs" during boot-up last?
2018-06-23 12:36:18	@Eisenstein	i might even have one lying around causasui

2018-06-23 13:55:55	@whitewolf	that speaker has what's called an internal crossover, it takes a full range signal for the left and right speakers and internally splits the subwoofer frequencies off and plays them through the sub
2018-06-23 13:56:11	@whitewolf	the computer should believe that there's only a 2.0 configuration

2018-06-23 14:08:25	Romillus	Went to the amazon site to start the return, and in that there was a support thing for it, and I just clicked it out of curiosity to see what they may say, and part of what they said what do a re-install of audio drivers, which I did try, but I looked into my settings because of that, and saw I had to programs trying to be the audio driver, deleted

2018-06-23 19:46:47	Zarinox	Hey folks. i was wondering if someone could help me with this issue. I have it all described in this post: So i just got this new 144hz monitor, and its fucking sick. I saw an instant improvement to my gameplay.
2018-06-23 19:46:48	Zarinox	Recently i have been having incredible framedrops, especially in high pressure moments.
2018-06-23 19:46:48	Zarinox	I have no idea whats causing this (exept im pretty sure its not a heating problem.)
2018-06-23 19:46:48	Zarinox	I should easily be able to have 144+ frames with my rig but something is wrong.
2018-06-23 19:46:48	Zarinox	I have tried updating/reinstalling my drivers, i have even tried going back to older drivers
2018-06-23 19:46:48	Zarinox	Hope you would like to help

2018-06-23 20:00:36	@Mikeee	CoJaBo:  it does not.
2018-06-23 20:00:36	@desgen	10% is better than none I guess
2018-06-23 20:01:34	CoJaBo	It used to be worse when 2-tap was mapped irreversibly to middle-click, because bumping the touchpad would paste large amounts of garbage into whatever channel happened to be up at the time

2018-06-23 21:21:15	@desgen	the percentage % for the GPU hovered around 20% a lot

2018-06-23 21:21:42	Zarinox	yes!
2018-06-23 21:22:01	@desgen	so we started with 20% performance loss

2018-06-23 21:22:22	@desgen	so that'll be the item with the fault
2018-06-23 21:22:25	@desgen	or having a spaz

2018-06-23 21:22:54	Zarinox	Can a 20% performance los really drop my fps that hard?
2018-06-23 21:23:04	Zarinox	if you've seen the youtube clip
2018-06-23 21:23:05	@desgen	for sure, or whatever is making that insane loss

2018-06-24 09:26:20	MickeyGP1378-	Hi, For some reason my virtual machines run very slowly, specially Windows 7 and below. The Aero animations are super slow and the performance overall is pretty bad. Windows 8.1 runs normally though. My PC is fairly powerful and I have also tried to use other virtualization software. Some advice?

I just bought a new headset and I want to be able to set it up so I can listen to my own voice (since I find it hard to talk when I use those noise cancellation headsets). So when I enable "listen to this device" under my microphone settings, I get a small delay and it sounds like an echo. Any way around this? I've tried everything Google has

2018-06-24 11:05:04	Zarinox	Corsair VS550 550W
2018-06-24 11:06:37	@whitewolf	i see two problems that need attention, the GTX 1060 is overheating and starting to throttle; 42% of the time in the trace was spent throttled
2018-06-24 11:06:51	@whitewolf	the other problem is that your PSU isn't delivering enough power resulting in throttling, 20% of the time
2018-06-24 11:07:24	@whitewolf	replace the PSU with a tier 1-2 650W+ PSU and clean out your fans and stuff for the thermal throttling
2018-06-24 11:08:09	Zarinox	My components should be fine. I haven't had this problem before
2018-06-24 11:08:15	Zarinox	it's a recent issue

2018-06-24 11:09:08	@whitewolf	12V down to 11.52V is a huge symptom of an overdriven PSU
2018-06-24 11:09:22	@whitewolf	https://cpy.pt/raw/DsaKDR8S
2018-06-24 11:09:42	@whitewolf	increasing system memory will help with stuttering due to swapping
2018-06-24 11:09:49	@whitewolf	as would getting a root volume SSD
2018-06-24 11:09:55	@whitewolf	but the immediate problems are the PSU and GPU temp
2018-06-24 11:10:48	@whitewolf	the average gpu_core voltage is 0.83, which is 15% lower than its max over the trace
2018-06-24 11:10:54	@whitewolf	that's probably why desgen said ~20% perf loss
2018-06-24 11:11:15	Zarinox	What solutions does not require me going out and getting new pieces
2018-06-24 11:11:39	@whitewolf	if your tier 5 PSU pops you'll be replacing all the pieces
2018-06-24 11:11:50	@whitewolf	you can keep using the machine until one of the pieces of hardware gives
2018-06-24 11:13:07	Zarinox	Sooo, new PSU?
2018-06-24 11:13:32	@Torrinco	Yes 
2018-06-24 11:13:48	Zarinox	I mean, its not that old
2018-06-24 11:14:05	Zarinox	i bought it in december
2018-06-24 11:14:14	@Torrinco	Doesn’t really matter, components go bad sometimes 
2018-06-24 11:14:40	Zarinox	and its now a software issue?
2018-06-24 11:14:45	Zarinox	not*
2018-06-24 11:15:02	@whitewolf	i broke it down above
2018-06-24 11:15:21	@Torrinco	It really doesn’t appear to be, whitewolf knows his business 
2018-06-24 11:15:27	@whitewolf	your PSU is showing that it can't handle the load on the 12V line, which accounts for about 20% of the throttling
2018-06-24 11:15:50	@whitewolf	the GTX 1060 is reaching thermal limit, which is about 40% of the time but about 5% of the throttling (a very light throttle)
2018-06-24 11:16:28	@whitewolf	you're reaching max memory, which can cause games to stutter -- but prime95 also uses more memory than some games, so that may not be the case (and is why it's an advisory fix not something i'm drilling home)
2018-06-24 11:16:37	@whitewolf	more RAM or an SSD would help that case tremendously
2018-06-24 11:16:46	@whitewolf	but i have no proof that would impact whatever game you reported this on
2018-06-24 11:17:06	@whitewolf	PSU and clean your shit
2018-06-24 11:17:20	Zarinox	Clean like less than a week ago
2018-06-24 11:17:43	Zarinox	probably not very thorough tho
2018-06-24 11:17:57	@whitewolf	gpu fan looks pretty clean going up to max RPM, so i doubt it's damaged
2018-06-24 11:18:01	@whitewolf	might give it a little more attention
2018-06-24 11:18:04	@whitewolf	note: do not let fans free spin
2018-06-24 11:18:12	@whitewolf	but seriously, replace that PSU
2018-06-24 11:19:19	@Torrinco	Zarinox did you pay attention to case airflow when you built it?
2018-06-24 11:19:28	Zarinox	Not really
2018-06-24 11:19:46	Zarinox	The cablemanagement is poop
2018-06-24 11:23:49	Zarinox	someone said to me that increasing my powerlimit on MSI afterburner would fix it
2018-06-24 11:24:04	@whitewolf	no that's not correct
2018-06-24 11:24:14	@whitewolf	that would be correct if you didn't have a PSU with a 12V line at 11.52V
2018-06-24 11:25:43	@Torrinco	Zarinox unfortunately you bought a shitty PSU to begin with 
2018-06-24 11:28:50	@whitewolf	should expect to spend roughly 10% of your builds cost on a PSU
2018-06-24 11:28:56	@whitewolf	$1500 machine gets a $100-$150 power supply
2018-06-24 11:29:33	Zarinox	What would you recommend?
2018-06-24 11:29:35	@Torrinco	PSU is actually the most important component, it shouldn’t be an afterthought

2018-06-24 11:31:30	Zarinox	Should i contact the company i bought the psu from? I still have insurance on it
2018-06-24 11:31:58	@whitewolf	only if you're able to return it

2018-06-24 13:22:11	Kal	Hi. My friend can't seem to open up his discord app on his PC. It gets stuck on "starting". Tried reinstalling, deleting folders and shutting it down from the task manager. Nothing works. Any ideas on how to fix this issue? The web version works tho
2018-06-24 13:22:37	@whitewolf	have you tried rebooting somewhere between uninstalling and reinstalling it
2018-06-24 13:22:57	Kal	I'll ask, one second
2018-06-24 13:23:10	@whitewolf	have him come join us
2018-06-24 13:26:14	Kal	He actually solved it now, by downloading the test-version of discord
2018-06-24 13:26:23	Kal	Thanks for the help tho!

2018-06-24 13:29:06	macuser928	Does USB-C support 4k @ 60hz, or only display port?
2018-06-24 13:29:36	@whitewolf	USB-C can carry a number of digital video signals
2018-06-24 13:29:44	@whitewolf	it depends on your machine's ability
2018-06-24 13:30:01	@whitewolf	what machine do you have?
2018-06-24 13:30:35	macuser928	I will be getting a new MBP (2017 or 18)
2018-06-24 13:31:19	macuser928	If I get a USB-C monitor with 4k, just wondering if I can get 60hz without having to use displayport
2018-06-24 13:31:59	@whitewolf	that monitor will be using displayport over USB-C, and the 13" and 15" MBP both support 4K@60Hz in that configuration
2018-06-24 13:32:22	macuser928	what do you mean display port over USB-c?
2018-06-24 13:32:37	@whitewolf	USB-C is a muxing port, it carries lots of signals
2018-06-24 13:32:48	@whitewolf	HDMI, DisplayPort, ThunderBolt 3, USB (obviously)... among others
2018-06-24 13:32:56	@whitewolf	the monitor will negotiate displayport over usb-c
2018-06-24 13:33:09	@whitewolf	and the 13/15" MBP support 4K@60Hz when doing that
2018-06-24 13:33:25	macuser928	So basically you are getting a display port signal through USB-c cable?
2018-06-24 13:33:29	@whitewolf	yup
2018-06-24 13:33:36	@whitewolf	along with optional power
2018-06-24 13:33:41	@whitewolf	it's a nifty port
2018-06-24 13:34:51	@whitewolf	google makes a really nice USB-C to DisplayPort cable just for that reason
2018-06-24 13:35:50	macuser928	So one other advantage of USB-c is that if the monitor has a built in usb hub, i can plug my I/O periphrials into the monitor without having to plug in any other cables. But if I don't have a USB-C monitor (just display port) then I would need a seperate USB cable to connect the monitor to my MBP correct?
2018-06-24 13:36:02	macuser928	assuming DiplayPort 1.2
2018-06-24 13:36:12	@whitewolf	correct
2018-06-24 13:36:28	@whitewolf	the old Apple Cinema Display worked that way - it was DP + USB cable
2018-06-24 13:36:40	@whitewolf	it was replaced with the Apple Thunderbolt Display which used Thunderbolt to combine the DP+USB
2018-06-24 13:36:47	@whitewolf	and now with USB-C, monitors combine power 
2018-06-24 13:36:50	macuser928	even with DP 1.2 you still need the extra USB cable?
2018-06-24 13:36:51	@whitewolf	so it's DP+USB+Power
2018-06-24 13:36:53	@whitewolf	yup
2018-06-24 13:37:08	macuser928	OK, thanks for the clarifications! :)
2018-06-24 13:37:11	@whitewolf	DP 1.2 allows audio to traverse the cable though
2018-06-24 13:37:22	@whitewolf	USB-C / Thunderbolt is the way to go

2018-06-24 14:10:16	vernoonica	hi! I unplugged a USB 3.0 cable from the back of my desktop today (it's an elgato cable, and I didn't pull it sideways or by the cord) and the pins inside my usb port ended up pretty bent. Is this usb port replaceable or should I just buy a USB hub?
2018-06-24 14:12:06	@Mikeee|	depends on the port
2018-06-24 14:12:11	@Mikeee|	and whether you can solder
2018-06-24 14:13:10	@desgen	vernoonica, did pins snap? you could consider RMA or just using a pens tip to bend them back
2018-06-24 14:14:14	@desgen	oh just the port itself
2018-06-24 14:14:16	@desgen	nvm
2018-06-24 14:17:41	vernoonica	upon closer inspection it looks like the plastic blue piece actually came out with the USB which seems much worse
2018-06-24 14:21:21	@whitewolf	the port is dead
2018-06-24 14:21:31	@whitewolf	a hub is a fine alternative for most users

2018-06-24 16:48:33	Mike007	everyone, I decided to vacuum my Mac in effort to reduce the insane cpu usage of kernel_task. I went over the entire Mac on the lowest vacuum setting, but bumped it up a few settings when it came time to clean the fan as dust was still lingering in there.
2018-06-24 16:48:33	Mike007	Obviously, I've knocked something loose or straight up broken it. A few minutes after turning my Mac back on there's this steady beeping sound coming from my fan.

2018-06-24 16:55:22	@Mikeee|	I hope it was a vacuum designed for electronics or he's likely done a lot of damage to the semiconductors.
2018-06-24 16:56:11	@Torrinco	Yeah the static buildup can be intense with a regular vacuum
2018-06-24 16:56:27	Mike007	The computer was entirely shut off. And it's a buzzing sound, not a beeping sound. My bad
2018-06-24 16:56:37	@Torrinco	But it sounds like he damaged the fan bearings 
2018-06-24 16:58:19	@Mikeee|	or the fan controller
2018-06-24 16:58:44	Mike007	I didn't even think of the possibility of static buildup. Goddamnit youtube videos can't be trusted.
2018-06-24 16:59:56	@Torrinco	You should never use a regular vacuum with computers, that is what those cans of compressed air are for 
2018-06-24 17:00:01	Mike007	Is fixing the fan bearings/controller something I might be able to fix myself?
2018-06-24 17:00:18	@Mikeee|	fan controllers are typically designed to protect against overcurrent but not backfeeding voltage from running the fan way too fast, or arcing from static buildup of a vacuum
2018-06-24 17:00:46	@Torrinco	You could probably just order a replacement fan online, you won’t be able to fix the fan 
2018-06-24 17:00:48	@Mikeee|	you could replace the fan, just in case the fan is problematic
2018-06-24 17:03:58	Mike007	Well, all right. I guess I'll just have to wait and see who breaks first: my Mac or I

2018-06-24 18:07:29	@Mikeee|	A vpn isn't magical
2018-06-24 18:08:32	@Mikeee|	there's still traffic from it, data being transfered
2018-06-24 18:08:33	@Mikeee|	If someone was to look at the packets it would be very obvious immediately that a VPN is being used.

2018-06-24 19:03:38	@desgen	did you drive it off the cliff as per plan?
2018-06-24 19:03:43	Chinesium	Mikeee|: There's ways to hide that you're using a VPN, I used to do it at school, not saying it was easy though
2018-06-24 19:03:55	Chinesium	desgen: Nah, the little fucker sticks to the road unfortunately
2018-06-24 19:04:01	@Mikeee|	not from a traffic analysis.
2018-06-24 19:04:20	Chinesium	They were running deep packet inspection and I still managed to jump through it
2018-06-24 19:04:30	@Mikeee|	or they just didn't care
2018-06-24 19:04:35	@Mikeee|	or you're just bullshitting
2018-06-24 19:04:52	Chinesium	I was tunneling it as email traffic
2018-06-24 19:04:53	@desgen	In China I bet nobody cares about a VPN since im more than certain the ALL use it there
2018-06-24 19:05:21	@desgen	who wants 1% internet?
2018-06-24 19:05:23	@Mikeee|	email traffic works in chunks of less than 20mb only.
2018-06-24 19:05:36	@Mikeee|	so its obvious to anyone who would look at the traffic
2018-06-24 19:05:42	@Mikeee|	or any software to automatically detect
2018-06-24 19:05:55	Chinesium	Maybe if a human looked at it, but the software just thought I had a lot of email
2018-06-24 19:06:14	Chinesium	Wouldn't work for streaming data, but for downloading blocked pages it was more than adequate
2018-06-24 19:06:17	@Mikeee|	Software says "hey this user is showing signs of using a VPN" and then the human looks.
2018-06-24 19:06:27	@Mikeee|	You only got away with it because they didn't care.
2018-06-24 19:06:53	@desgen	Again, I bet a VPN is a common piece of software in china, for sure
2018-06-24 19:07:11	Chinesium	Again, not in China, have never been to Asia
2018-06-24 19:07:20	@desgen	Oh
2018-06-24 19:07:39	@desgen	Around China?
2018-06-24 19:07:58	@desgen	I'm pretty sure you're in China
2018-06-24 19:08:03	Chinesium	UK, usually
2018-06-24 19:08:08	@desgen	same thing
2018-06-24 19:08:19	Chinesium	Yeah but we don't eat dogs, we just deep fry everything
2018-06-24 19:08:21	@desgen	like literally the same thing
2018-06-24 19:08:24	@desgen	they're communists 
2018-06-24 19:08:58	@desgen	communists cock block the internet, both UK and China share this goal
2018-06-24 19:09:13	@desgen	a VPN is a common practice in communist countries
2018-06-24 19:09:21	@desgen	now the US, since we're getting a hint of it
2018-06-24 19:09:28	Chinesium	Hey, just because my government doesn't like porn -_-
2018-06-24 19:09:40	@Mikeee|	A VPN doesn't protect against NN violations in any way.

2018-06-24 21:11:45	DYLAN	What makes you say that? And how could i fix or confirm thats my issue
2018-06-24 21:12:05	@desgen	several ways, one easy way would be a multimeter
2018-06-24 21:12:23	@desgen	next would be attempting an OS reinstall, and logging in hardware monitoring programs
2018-06-24 21:12:40	@desgen	DYLAN, do you have a multimeter?
2018-06-24 21:12:47	DYLAN	No lol.
2018-06-24 21:12:59	@desgen	anyone in your house that might?
2018-06-24 21:13:21	@desgen	if anyone works on a car a lot, they might have one
2018-06-24 21:13:58	DYLAN	Maybe a neighbor. But no access to one right now
2018-06-24 21:14:36	@desgen	hands are tied without tools to confirm, and especially no parts to replace
2018-06-24 21:14:46	@desgen	that leaves you with the next proposed option
2018-06-24 21:15:40	@desgen	third one would just literally "replace the PSU" because regardless, that model is a fire hazzard
2018-06-24 21:15:48	@desgen	and could bring down more than you'd like to see brought down
2018-06-24 21:16:31	DYLAN	Okay great thanks ill try that tomorrow
2018-06-24 21:17:10	@desgen	ok
2018-06-24 21:17:42	DYLAN	But a bad psu would cause a bootloop?
2018-06-24 21:17:49	@desgen	not usually
2018-06-24 21:18:00	@desgen	not likely, even
2018-06-24 21:18:47	@desgen	but im suspecting things since you've recently upgraded and then had this issue
2018-06-24 21:19:16	@desgen	I need an OS
2018-06-24 21:19:22	@desgen	even Ubuntu could tell us things
2018-06-24 21:19:33	@desgen	but a non loading OS give me 0 chance to confirm much of anything
2018-06-24 21:19:44	@desgen	understand that DYLAN?
2018-06-24 21:19:46	DYLAN	How can i get to safe mode?
2018-06-24 21:19:58	DYLAN	It makes sense yeah.
2018-06-24 21:20:07	@desgen	force power off during boot loading screen 
2018-06-24 21:20:12	@desgen	it'll detect something is wrong

2018-06-24 21:20:39	DYLAN	Diagnosing windows is what it says
2018-06-24 21:20:53	DYLAN	And then it says cannot diagnose windows
2018-06-24 21:21:02	DYLAN	No safe mode..
2018-06-24 21:21:04	@desgen	ok, lets restart this
2018-06-24 21:21:07	@desgen	what did you do?
2018-06-24 21:21:15	@desgen	last time the PC worked
2018-06-24 21:21:20	@desgen	did you install ANYTHING
2018-06-24 21:21:23	@desgen	or do ANYTHING
2018-06-24 21:21:27	@desgen	that might have caused ANYTHING
2018-06-24 21:22:16	DYLAN	Yes actually.. My daughter hit my tower and it fell over
2018-06-24 21:22:32	DYLAN	Not hard enough for me to think any hardware damage would be done..
2018-06-24 21:23:10	DYLAN	It froze after that, successfully booted up,  i was browsing reddit and got bsod then boot loop and here we are.
2018-06-24 21:23:36	@desgen	ok, so we know it's hardware related
2018-06-24 21:24:05	@desgen	im going to assume the HDD took a beeting
2018-06-24 21:24:07	@desgen	beating*
2018-06-24 21:25:02	DYLAN	I have 2 hdd and a ssd. Could i try to boot windows another hdd?
2018-06-24 21:25:11	DYLAN	Win is currently on my ssd
2018-06-24 21:26:14	@desgen	YES
2018-06-24 21:26:17	@desgen	oops*
2018-06-24 21:26:18	@desgen	yes*
2018-06-24 21:26:24	@desgen	or a usb flash drive
2018-06-24 21:26:35	@desgen	anything that can hold data, and loaded with live Ubuntu
2018-06-24 21:26:40	@desgen	will suffice just fine
2018-06-24 21:26:52	DYLAN	I bave
2018-06-24 21:27:09	DYLAN	I have a 7 gig usb and blank dvdr
2018-06-24 21:27:14	@desgen	good enough
2018-06-24 21:27:18	@desgen	go get ubuntu iso
2018-06-24 21:27:22	@desgen	use rufus to flash it
2018-06-24 21:27:28	DYLAN	And an ancient laptop
2018-06-24 21:27:53	DYLAN	Okay. Googling ubuntu iso and rufus will take me where i need to go?
2018-06-24 21:28:59	@desgen	DYLAN, mostly, depends on the google skills
2018-06-24 21:29:27	@desgen	rufus is the tool to flash, you can imagine that, and ubuntu iso is what you load into rufus to flash to a usb flash drive
2018-06-24 21:29:46	@desgen	then you boot into the usb flash drive, like most things you've done in the passed with windows
2018-06-24 21:29:55	@desgen	past*
2018-06-24 21:30:46	DYLAN	Gotcha.  Working on that now.

2018-06-25 15:32:52	@desgen	but godamn, everything cant be shitty
2018-06-25 15:33:04	@whitewolf	i spoke with some guys from vmware the other day
2018-06-25 15:33:14	@whitewolf	they said it makes them sad when people capitalize the W in VMware
2018-06-25 15:33:18	@whitewolf	it's not VMWare 
2018-06-25 15:33:32	helpwithVirtualB	Is it ok that I hold shift when restarting to enter BIOS? I am not sure what the key is or if I will be fast enough....
2018-06-25 15:33:49	helpwithVirtualB	Should I restart or was changing it one time now enough?
2018-06-25 15:34:06	Chinesium	desgen: I just dislike that virtualbox pretty kuch *requires* you to use VBoxManage.exe to change anything other than basic settings
2018-06-25 15:34:09	helpwithVirtualB	System information popped up because I didn't close it before and
2018-06-25 15:34:13	Chinesium	whitewolf: Huh
2018-06-25 15:34:16	@desgen	Chinesium, not a point
2018-06-25 15:34:23	helpwithVirtualB	one of the 4 yes in the end is now a no

2018-06-25 15:34:51	@whitewolf	Chinesium: it's VMware not VMWare, just one of the little things that makes them sad
2018-06-25 15:34:52	@desgen	virtualbox works on my machine(s)
2018-06-25 15:34:59	helpwithVirtualB	So it worked or should I restart doing nothing just restart>
2018-06-25 15:35:01	helpwithVirtualB	?
2018-06-25 15:35:09	Chinesium	whitewolf: so it is, I've never noticed thta
2018-06-25 15:35:16	Chinesium	helpwithVirtualB: What did you change, and what to?
2018-06-25 15:35:43	Chinesium	desgen: virtualbox does work, usually, but occasionally it has hiccups that are an absolute pain to fix, and it really dislikes guest OSes that do weird stuff
2018-06-25 15:35:51	@desgen	does vmware hiccup?
2018-06-25 15:35:58	@desgen	does software hiccup?
2018-06-25 15:36:00	Chinesium	Sure does
2018-06-25 15:36:03	@whitewolf	not nearly as easily heh
2018-06-25 15:36:06	@whitewolf	i abuse vmware daily
2018-06-25 15:36:09	Chinesium	I find VMware easier to fix as well
2018-06-25 15:36:14	helpwithVirtualB	Intel's virtualization technology? I really don't recall the exact name... I will make sure I note it down
2018-06-25 15:36:20	helpwithVirtualB	when I go to bios again
2018-06-25 15:36:21	Chinesium	I run MacOS in VMware, I don't do it in virtualbox
2018-06-25 15:37:05	@desgen	i'll give virtualbox a "works for my needs/10"
2018-06-25 15:37:06	@whitewolf	it helps that vmware and parallels are supported targets for macOS
2018-06-25 15:37:27	@desgen	vmware is "too much for my needs/10"
2018-06-25 15:37:38	@whitewolf	no such thing as too much heh
2018-06-25 15:37:42	@desgen	TOO MUCH
2018-06-25 15:37:47	helpwithVirtualB	So... do you want a restart and after restart try enabling? or try immediately restarting to BIOS?
2018-06-25 15:37:51	@Mandevwin	whitewolf, tell that to your mom
2018-06-25 15:38:05	@whitewolf	i think i have

2018-06-25 15:39:28	@Mandevwin	desgen, yes, it is
2018-06-25 15:39:33	helpwithVirtualB	or should I go try enable it again and try then?

2018-06-25 22:27:07	GRagas	it started with dauntless, then it did it on every game if I ran my computer a little long. Just recently it was Diablo 3. My CPU was actually overheating like 90c+ sometimes, but I got that fixed today with a new cooler I installed since I thought that was the cause.
2018-06-25 22:27:23	GRagas	I was watching Temps and shit and nothing was rising to cause it so I wasn't sure

2018-06-25 22:53:50	@DoctorDick	And then reinstalling the drivers and that game and seeing if the issue still occurs

2018-06-25 23:10:03	Oludus	ASUS Z170 Pro Gaming
2018-06-25 23:10:20	@DoctorDick	You updated the BIOS prior to the upgrade correct?
2018-06-25 23:10:37	Oludus	I've tried I'm not sure if it worked
2018-06-25 23:10:43	Oludus	I removed the CMOS battery
2018-06-25 23:10:47	@DoctorDick	Because you need a BIOS update in order for a 7th gen intel processor to work in a Z170 board
2018-06-25 23:10:55	Oludus	and also shorted the two cmos pins
2018-06-25 23:11:02	@DoctorDick	That's not a BIOS update
2018-06-25 23:11:07	@DoctorDick	That's just a CMOS reset
2018-06-25 23:11:10	Oludus	D:
2018-06-25 23:11:32	Oludus	oh so do I update bios beforeI put the i7 in?
2018-06-25 23:11:36	@DoctorDick	Yep
2018-06-25 23:12:14	Oludus	so if I put my i5 back in, go into my BOIS settings, reset them, and put my i7 back it should work...

2018-06-25 23:12:58	Oludus	ok
2018-06-25 23:13:01	@DoctorDick	Consult your mobo manual to find the proper procedure for a BIOS update

2018-06-25 23:38:32	@DoctorDick	The i7 isn't supported because you didn't have a BIOS version that was compatible with the 7th gen Intel processors

2018-06-25 23:56:49	denadryne	eh i dont have a flashdrive

2018-06-25 23:59:49	CoJaBo	denadryne: Enter usually at least selects stuff, so if enter only works on the external board and only enter doesn't work on the internal, you can be sure it's hardware. Sometimes it's possible to fix the keys, there's guides on Youtube to popping the keys off without damaging them
2018-06-26 00:01:34	denadryne	so youre saying those keys should be detected on the BIOS menu
2018-06-26 00:02:10	@desgen	thinkpads are simple
2018-06-26 00:02:13	@desgen	you just pop it out

2018-06-26 00:24:05	Pet97	so if it gets struck like at the picture, I resort to turning the system off by pressing the on button or pull the plug out
2018-06-26 00:24:17	CoJaBo	I second checking the SMART status; had a random hang myself at the very end of BIOS screen, turned out to be failing disk.
2018-06-26 00:25:00	@DoctorDick	That's usually the case

2018-06-26 00:42:34	@DoctorDick	It tests for PSU voltages, CPU voltages, temps, GPU voltages, temps, etc
2018-06-26 00:42:41	@DoctorDick	It's like 100 data points
2018-06-26 00:42:50	cena100	@DoctorDick i am the same guy from a few hours with the ping issues after i did a network reset someone said to me i would need a new pc or a new router to fix this issue i tried a recovery nothing worked

2018-06-26 00:44:27	@DoctorDick	If that's what you want to do, that's your choice
2018-06-26 00:44:37	@DoctorDick	But it's probably not your PC
2018-06-26 00:44:43	CoJaBo	cena100: ethernet or wifi?
2018-06-26 00:44:52	cena100	@DoctorDick i dont want to i want someones help like in here
2018-06-26 00:45:02	cena100	@CoJaBo ethernet
2018-06-26 00:45:30	@DoctorDick	It's most likely a routing issue with your ISP or the server moved to a datacenter farther away from you
2018-06-26 00:45:43	CoJaBo	Are you pinging local IPs or remote?
2018-06-26 00:46:02	cena100	@DoctorDick thats what someone else said but its weird that it could happen exactly when i do a network reset
2018-06-26 00:46:34	@DoctorDick	You probably got a new IP from your ISP and that IP range has a different route that your previous one
2018-06-26 00:47:12	@DoctorDick	You should connect directly to your modem with ethernet and do a traceroute to the game's server IP
2018-06-26 00:47:42	cena100	i am already connected directly
2018-06-26 00:48:15	@DoctorDick	What is the model of your modem?
2018-06-26 00:48:25	cena100	not sure but isp TalkTalk
2018-06-26 00:48:30	CoJaBo	cena100: And you've confirmed that ping times to LAN IPs and other servers aren't affected?
2018-06-26 00:48:33	@DoctorDick	SO go check
2018-06-26 00:49:08	Pet97	@DoctorDick Just curious, did you ever suggest to someone to buy a new pc because it is so badly damaged/old?
2018-06-26 00:49:38	@DoctorDick	Sure, if the parts required to fix it are more expensive than a replacement
2018-06-26 00:49:54	@DoctorDick	It's just not financially feasible at that point
2018-06-26 00:50:04	cena100	@DoctorDick i went to check but i dont know where it sais the model number
2018-06-26 00:50:12	@DoctorDick	cena100, On the bottom
2018-06-26 00:50:19	CoJaBo	If it's a network issue, absolute worst case is a new ethernet card or modem lol
2018-06-26 00:50:27	Pet97	ok thanks, ill do the stress test soon
2018-06-26 00:50:36	CoJaBo	Or cable. Can't count the number of times it's been the damned cable <_<
2018-06-26 00:50:37	Pet97	thanks alot for your help guys
2018-06-26 00:50:37	@DoctorDick	If it's a modem issue, your ISP will take care of it

2018-06-26 00:55:17	@DoctorDick	That's just a software reset
2018-06-26 00:55:28	@DoctorDick	It literally does nothing to your router/modem
2018-06-26 00:56:34	CoJaBo	If you're connected directly to the modem, it could cause your WAN IP to change, which could unmask an ISP routing issue. Or, it could be pure coincidence. Or, if the issue is local, it could be a driver issue, so you should still rule that out if you haven't already
2018-06-26 00:56:42	cena100	@DoctorDick after doing that my ping has messed up and then the guy i spoke to started talking about computer id and was like there is no fix unless you got a new pc
2018-06-26 00:57:08	CoJaBo	cena100: What are your ping times to IPs other than the game server, and to your modem's LAN IP?
2018-06-26 00:57:25	@DoctorDick	cena100, I'm still waiting on the screenshot to your modem/router

2018-06-26 01:04:40	CoJaBo	cena100: Have you tried pinging the modem's IP yet, for one?
2018-06-26 01:04:52	@DoctorDick	Do a traceroute
2018-06-26 01:04:58	@DoctorDick	Don't do a ping
2018-06-26 01:05:10	@DoctorDick	Do a traceroute to the game server

2018-06-26 01:05:48	@DoctorDick	"tracert IPADDRESS" in cmd prompt

2018-06-26 01:06:32	@DoctorDick	That router/modem combo is fucking garbage
2018-06-26 01:06:36	@DoctorDick	It only does 100M

2018-06-26 01:08:02	@DoctorDick	Then contact that game's support and ask them
2018-06-26 01:08:11	@DoctorDick	Or use Google
2018-06-26 01:09:06	CoJaBo	cena100: As a simple sanity check, tracert or ping the modem's IP and 8.8.8.8
2018-06-26 01:09:22	@DoctorDick	I'd traceroute 8.8.8.8
2018-06-26 01:09:28	@DoctorDick	There's more data to work with
2018-06-26 01:09:45	cena100	@DoctorDick how do i traceroute 8.8.8.8
2018-06-26 01:09:52	@DoctorDick	tracert 8.8.8.8

2018-06-26 01:12:27	@DoctorDick	If you're having this issue on all games, then it's a routing issue
2018-06-26 01:12:43	@DoctorDick	There's nothing wrong with that traceroute
2018-06-26 01:12:46	cena100	@DoctorDick like on overwatch a constant 45 on fortnite rises from 30-40 sometimes 50

2018-06-26 01:14:48	@DoctorDick	Your ISP probably changed routing

2018-06-26 01:15:24	cena100	@DoctorDick it is a big coincidence how it has happened as i have done a network reset

2018-06-26 01:16:26	cena100	@DoctorDick tbh i still think that its becuase i did the network reset becuase my speed test shows a lower ping at 17ms
2018-06-26 01:16:30	@DoctorDick	They use AWS like the rest of us
2018-06-26 01:16:39	CoJaBo	Hell, my pingtimes would vary by ±50ms depending on time of day
2018-06-26 01:17:06	@DoctorDick	That's a big jump
2018-06-26 01:17:39	CoJaBo	Comcast :/
2018-06-26 01:17:40	@DoctorDick	Mine usually stays around 5-10ms
2018-06-26 01:18:06	cena100	mine did stay around 20-30 usally 26 but now its messed
2018-06-26 01:18:14	@DoctorDick	It's 40 ms
2018-06-26 01:18:19	@DoctorDick	That's not even bad
2018-06-26 01:18:25	@DoctorDick	This is literally a non issue
2018-06-26 01:18:38	CoJaBo	I still regularly have minutes-long periods where ping is over 8,000ms. Can't even fricking surf with that
2018-06-26 01:18:47	CoJaBo	Be glad your ISP isn't comcast rofl
2018-06-26 01:18:51	@DoctorDick	It's probably an overloaded node

2018-06-26 01:40:40	@DoctorDick	Your ISP isn't doing anything wrong
2018-06-26 01:40:49	@DoctorDick	You get 46ms with them

2018-06-26 01:41:07	@DoctorDick	There's nothing wrong with either of that
2018-06-26 01:41:09	cena100	i was getting 26 though

2018-06-26 01:42:12	cena100	@DoctorDick but it changes just after i do all that network reset stuff
2018-06-26 01:42:29	@DoctorDick	Changes to what?
2018-06-26 01:42:39	CoJaBo	cena100: Almost certainly coincidence
2018-06-26 01:42:51	cena100	like my ping changes just after i do that network reset thing
2018-06-26 01:42:59	@DoctorDick	Your ping always changes
2018-06-26 01:43:03	@DoctorDick	Literally every millisecond
2018-06-26 01:43:04	cena100	i did it one more than one occasaion that could mess it up
2018-06-26 01:44:09	CoJaBo	cena100: Unless your router is set to passthru/DMZ/NAT-disable or something bizarre like that, your network reset thru Windows can't even affect the side of the traceroute that has higher ping now. Coincidence.

2018-06-26 01:44:50	cena100	i mean the only last thing i can do is get access to another computer in my house and install fortnite then check the ping
2018-06-26 01:45:20	CoJaBo	cena100: If you had some kind of weird flaky driver that broke, you'd have high pings to LAN IPs. But your paste shows your lan ping as "<1ms", which is literally nothing
2018-06-26 01:46:03	CoJaBo	cena100: Trying from another computer would also only change the LAN ping, which will still be pretty close to 0ms

2018-06-26 01:47:21	hatrick	My microphones (2 x BT headphones) only work in some applications. All applications see the recording device but there is simply no level in some applications. The bar on the recording device never shows input when the mic is working.
2018-06-26 01:47:23	CoJaBo	If LAN ping is ever high, it'd indicate a local hardware or driver fault; but your tracert ping times of <1ms rule that out.

2018-06-26 01:55:20	CoJaBo	serotuna: It sounds like it's picking up interference, or possibly amplifying any interference coming from the soundcard; that's the amp in the speakers being bad or unshielded, there's not a whole lot you can do to fix that other than trying less wireless stuff around it..

2018-06-26 02:00:47	CoJaBo	Weirdest wrong-port issue I've ever seen: Speakers accidentally plugged into mic port caused a Win95 machine to take geological eras to boot. Still have no idea how that could have happened.
2018-06-26 02:00:54	serotuna	i don't hear any static or interference when using the DAC with headphones, does that narrow it down at all?
2018-06-26 02:01:32	CoJaBo	serotuna: Seems to point to speakers then, IMHO. Test the speakers with some totally other device tho to be sure

2018-06-26 02:15:03	serotuna	yers
2018-06-26 02:15:17	serotuna	they are plugged into the DAC, i just plugged the DAC into the laptop instead of the PC and listened for buzzing
2018-06-26 02:15:27	serotuna	none in the laptop, very much in the PC
2018-06-26 02:16:21	CoJaBo	It's possible it's amplifying noise from the desktop thru the cable or something, which a ferrite core might fix. Unless the DAC itself is what's bad.. weird.
2018-06-26 02:16:45	@Shadeblast	serotuna, are you changing the volume using the pc or the speakers?

2018-06-26 02:53:39	ERandz	Hi all! So my girlfriend left her quite old external hard drive in her laptop. Now she's plug it in today to find that it doesn't work anymore. Looking at the outer casing, it has warped just above the data/power io. Is there anyway to take the external HDD apart and buy a chassis to test the HDD?
2018-06-26 02:59:41	@Shadeblast	ERandz, depends, what brand / model is it?
2018-06-26 02:59:53	@Shadeblast	Some older ones have a normal HDD in it you can just install in another enclosure/pc
2018-06-26 03:00:20	ERandz	It's a seagate Model SRD00f1 and it is fairly old
2018-06-26 03:01:36	ERandz	I'll have a look at that model online and see if I can discern whether that's the case. Thanks!

2018-06-26 03:03:31	@Shadeblast	ERandz, keep in mind that the PCB could still have fried the HDD's header
2018-06-26 03:03:44	@Shadeblast	ERandz, and if it's absolutely vital data a data recovery company is a smarter choice
2018-06-26 03:04:34	ERandz	Yeah, that's what I'm worried about actually. I may just suggest she take it to some pros as it's years of data
2018-06-26 03:05:34	CoJaBo	ERandz: In almost all cases I've seen, if the HDD doesn't spin up/make any noise, it's generally the enclosure that's fried. It generally *should* be safe to plug it into a normal PC in that case
2018-06-26 03:06:29	@Shadeblast	Yeah agreed, but, that depends on how vital the data is

2018-06-26 08:46:10	ShazNasty	Hey everyone. I'm having an issue with my laptop going into a boot loop and not recognizing my SSD. However if I recover to factory default it usually starts up fine and recognizes my SSD again.
2018-06-26 08:46:38	haze_	ShazNasty, got another drive to test with?
2018-06-26 08:47:11	ShazNasty	I have an external hard drive I can use or a 16gb usb.
2018-06-26 08:47:19	ShazNasty	Are both okay?
2018-06-26 08:48:05	haze_	ShazNasty, can you get to the HDD in the external. Is it OK to format this drive if so?
2018-06-26 08:48:33	ShazNasty	I'd rather not format it if it means I'll lose all of my data.
2018-06-26 08:50:11	haze_	ShazNasty, you say the computer works fine after a factory reset. Could be a BSOD. Do you see the windows loading and then a sudden reboot?
2018-06-26 08:51:44	ShazNasty	This is the second time I've had this boot loop. This time it would load up windows every once and a while and immediately blue screen. However, about 80% of the time it would go straight to BIOS settings. In the BIOS my SSD was not under the boot options.
2018-06-26 08:52:21	haze_	ShazNasty, OK. That does sound like a failing SSD.
2018-06-26 08:52:53	ShazNasty	Ah I see, should I try replacing the SSD or just go for another laptop?

2018-06-26 15:05:38	Abigail	Hi, I just built my first computer and I'm having troubles getting the front audio jack to work. Mobo is GIGABYTE B360M DS3H. I have the cable from the chassis labeled "audio" plugged into the f_audio port on my mobo. I've unplugged and replugged this connection about 5 times now. Mobo OEM has 3 win 10 drivers available, and I've alternated between
2018-06-26 15:05:38	Abigail	 all three. I've checked playback devices several times and nothing is disabled, all sliders are > 0. rear audio jack does work.

2018-06-26 15:07:54	zer0	so neither front or back are working but on does indicate that one is "not working"?
2018-06-26 15:08:08	Abigail	no, the back audio jack does output sound
2018-06-26 15:08:38	Abigail	I've just noticed that when I plug the headphones into that jack, I get a toast from Realtek Audio Manager.

2018-06-26 18:18:04	CoJaBo	At that point, it's more expensive to repair than to replace; you'd only ever repair that level of damage if it was a vintage one or something.

2018-07-18 21:44:53	stupid	Ok that's what I was thinking. As a general rule though even if open on my personal computer but I don't access it via the virtual I'm fine?
2018-07-18 21:45:02	@PipeItToDevNull	yes 
2018-07-18 21:45:13	@PipeItToDevNull	the horizon client is a tunnel to a virtual server at work 
2018-07-18 21:45:36	@PipeItToDevNull	it is a "window" nothing else on your machine is sent 
2018-07-18 21:45:55	@whitewolf	horizon can send back some information, but it's mostly about if you leave kisok mode on VMs that enforce it and that kind of thing

2018-07-19 17:44:46	Seafu	nvm I got the wrong driver -.-
2018-07-19 17:46:06	LordOfLiam	The A key came off my laptop, it's back on but it pops off when I tap the lower half of it. What should I do?
2018-07-19 17:46:57	LordOfLiam	Also I carefully removed the S key next to it, and put it in A's place. It went in fine, so I'm assuming the problem lies with the A key itself, and not the plastic piece holding it to the laptop
2018-07-19 17:47:11	MikeFromIT	The switch is probably broken
2018-07-19 17:48:21	MikeFromIT	Easiest thing to do would be buy a replacement and then pop it on there
2018-07-19 17:48:22	LordOfLiam	Is the switch on the key itself? I could just buy another one online, right?

2018-07-19 22:24:33	Laura19	yeah there are a lot of devices connected to the network, more than i know of probably
2018-07-19 22:25:00	MikeFromIT	Well when you do a factory reset on the router it'll remove all of them
2018-07-19 22:25:27	Laura19	i dont understand why everything im trying isn't working.  i think i did all of that when it first happened a year and a half ago.
2018-07-19 22:25:49	Laura19	i probably should have bought a new router
2018-07-19 22:26:17	Laura19	i think he may have did something to make it hard deliberately
2018-07-19 22:26:51	Laura19	my neigbors know him
2018-07-19 22:27:57	Laura19	i dont even know why im talking about this.
2018-07-19 22:28:14	Laura19	all i really should have to say is someone was being manipulative, that's why im looking bad
2018-07-19 22:28:17	MikeFromIT	Unless he has a chip or something actually installed directly into the router I highly doubt he'll have persitence after a reset
2018-07-19 22:28:29	Laura19	yeah, he had someone come into the house probably
2018-07-19 22:29:13	Laura19	long story
2018-07-19 22:29:52	MikeFromIT	I mean if someone is still able to access your actual house you should probably look into changing your locks or something
2018-07-19 22:29:59	Laura19	that's the problem he is doing weird stuff though
2018-07-19 22:30:00	Laura19	yeah
2018-07-19 22:30:20	Laura19	well i moved out because of this so i can take better care of myself
2018-07-19 22:32:19	Laura19	well he put spy cameras in the house too i had to see stuff all the time, pictures of stuff, getting hints of stuff im doing around my house, especially if it was something that made him mad or jealous.  nobody really cares, i live in a small town and the cops dont know anything about this stuff and aren't even good at their jobs so they are useles
2018-07-19 22:32:19	Laura19	s.
2018-07-19 22:32:39	Laura19	so if there are spy cameras then there could be other stuff
2018-07-19 22:32:52	Laura19	good bug detector costs too much and they could be gone by now
2018-07-19 22:34:05	Laura19	but i pretty much heard most of that was a router hack so i guess it would make sense he did it by having physical access to it
2018-07-19 22:36:22	Laura19	i dont understand why its hard to find info online of similar stuff.  i mean not all of that stuff.  But editing websites and stuff?

2018-07-19 22:37:10	Laura19	Like they can change the balance in your bank accounts, or what it says on the site, then steal it
2018-07-19 22:38:28	MikeFromIT	Live editing of websites while you're active on them is pretty unlikely
2018-07-19 22:38:48	MikeFromIT	Even any type of editing websites is pretty unlikely
2018-07-19 22:38:55	Laura19	i don't see stuff change while i'm on them.
2018-07-19 22:38:58	Laura19	Yeah.
2018-07-19 22:39:16	MikeFromIT	You'd be more likely to have some type of DNS poisoning going on
2018-07-19 22:39:21	Laura19	He is good at it, it's easy for him.
2018-07-19 22:40:02	Laura19	dns spoofing = poisoning?
2018-07-19 22:40:21	Laura19	you can make fake sites like a fake instagram page? or would it more likely just be edited?
2018-07-19 22:41:16	MikeFromIT	DNS poisoning is when you type "www.google.com" and you get redirected to a website that isn't google's ip address
2018-07-19 22:41:24	Laura19	he did stuff like flooding my twitter feed with fake looking posts, or stuff i looked at from a long time, stuff i wasn't looking for, or just lots of fake posts
2018-07-19 22:41:31	Laura19	yeah
2018-07-19 22:41:56	Laura19	I know there is ip address associated with the site name and you can change it to make it go a cloned site
2018-07-19 22:42:14	MikeFromIT	I mean, I'm not saying you're lying or anything. But that all seems very unlikely
2018-07-19 22:42:23	Laura19	i took intro to networking 10 years ago, that's my limit
2018-07-19 22:42:27	Laura19	it is very unlikely
2018-07-19 22:42:30	Laura19	that's why im having problems
2018-07-19 22:42:37	Laura19	among other reasons
2018-07-19 22:43:49	Laura19	if you want to know another thing he can do is change people's clothes and make it look natural, on a youtube video, or a show im watching on netflix
2018-07-19 22:44:01	Laura19	he can edit thumbnails on netflix
2018-07-19 22:44:14	Laura19	oh it will show up the same both on my laptop and on the roku i use
2018-07-19 22:44:24	Laura19	i think he said that clothing thing was AI

2018-07-19 22:46:02	@DoctorDick	That's not possible

2018-07-19 22:46:16	Laura19	yes.

2018-07-20 00:19:48	@DoctorDick	Check which model you have it's 2-5 years depending on the model
2018-07-20 00:21:08	Fizzleout	its the 400 series 470 model it only has it for the 480
2018-07-20 00:22:03	@DoctorDick	You might want to call them and ask
2018-07-20 00:22:26	Fizzleout	okay will do. DO you think im screwed and need a new GPU?
2018-07-20 00:22:36	@DoctorDick	I think you'll be able to RMA it
2018-07-20 00:23:03	Fizzleout	okay thank you very much do you know exactly whats going wrong with it?
2018-07-20 00:23:04	@DoctorDick	You should be cover at the very least until Sept 2018
2018-07-20 00:23:11	@DoctorDick	Since that when they came out +2 years
2018-07-20 00:23:17	Fizzleout	gotcha
2018-07-20 00:23:22	@DoctorDick	There's a cooling issue
2018-07-20 00:23:31	@DoctorDick	The paste probably gone bad and needs to be replaced
2018-07-20 00:23:45	Fizzleout	gotcha. thank you so much for the help ill update you momentarily.

2018-07-20 00:33:02	hatshepsut	i need to plug my PCs into outlets via extension cords, will some nice beefy 12-gauge cords work?
2018-07-20 00:34:44	@whitewolf	how long
2018-07-20 00:35:44	Fizzleout	Thank you DoctorDick for helping me out i shot them a ticket and ill hopefully get this figured out.,
2018-07-20 00:35:50	@DoctorDick	Great
2018-07-20 00:36:48	hatshepsut	@whitewolf 25 ft or 50 ft, probably 50
2018-07-20 00:37:02	Fizzleout	if things dont work out with the warranty would a gtx 1050ti 4gb card suffice?

2018-07-20 00:40:17	@whitewolf	hatshepsut: 14Ga is fine for that length and load a PC would put onto it
2018-07-20 00:40:27	@whitewolf	hatshepsut: so 12Ga is certainly fine
2018-07-20 00:41:38	hatshepsut	so i could grab a 14GA 50' and it'd be enough to power my 750w pc (not that it ever uses 750w total probably)?
2018-07-20 00:41:41	hatshepsut	how 'bout amps? 15 good?
2018-07-20 00:42:02	@whitewolf	14 gauge is good for ~15 amps at 50 feet

2018-07-20 00:44:01	@whitewolf	another XFX card bites the dust
2018-07-20 00:44:09	hatshepsut	yeh i've got two pcs on the same circuit right now which is why I want to buy another cord so I can move one to a separate circuit
2018-07-20 00:44:56	@whitewolf	DoctorDick: check out the "GPU VRM Power Out (POUT)" track and the "GPU VRM Voltage In (VIN/+12V)" data sources
2018-07-20 00:46:42	@DoctorDick	RIP
2018-07-20 00:46:44	@DoctorDick	Oh well
2018-07-20 00:47:04	@whitewolf	so it goes, you got that it was the gpu
2018-07-20 00:47:11	@DoctorDick	Not too worried, he's RMAing it anyway
2018-07-20 00:47:20	@whitewolf	agreed
2018-07-20 00:47:49	@whitewolf	i suspect the GPU gets hotter because it will pull more current for a given clock rate if the VRMs aren't pumping out enough power
2018-07-20 00:47:55	@whitewolf	so it shows up in the temperature also
2018-07-20 00:48:13	@whitewolf	but the GPU Clock + GPU Power + GPU +12VIN is enough to say that you have another XFX card with shitty power syndrome
2018-07-20 00:49:20	hatshepsut	is it a bad idea to share the pc with the same circuit the water heater and washer/dryer are on or is there enough wiggle room/overhead there
2018-07-20 00:49:29	@whitewolf	it is a bad idea.
2018-07-20 00:49:34	hatshepsut	gaddamn
2018-07-20 00:49:51	@DoctorDick	If you're going to do that, at least buy an UPS
2018-07-20 00:50:13	@DoctorDick	But that's a lot of power sucking appliances
2018-07-20 00:51:33	@whitewolf	sounds like what you really need is a new circuit ran
2018-07-20 00:51:43	hatshepsut	what i really need to do is move
2018-07-20 00:52:05	hatshepsut	until then i need to leech my way into the house as efficiently as possible
2018-07-20 00:53:10	hatshepsut	how much can one circuit handle?
2018-07-20 00:54:11	hatshepsut	i've got one pc and my trailer, which isn't much more than some lights, a heater, a microwave and a lot of spiders, plugged into one of the house circuits atm
2018-07-20 00:55:12	@whitewolf	the heater is the huge power draw there
2018-07-20 00:55:22	@whitewolf	one household circuit is either 15A or 20A depending
2018-07-20 00:55:42	hatshepsut	its a lil rinky dink heater, i do try to keep it off most of the time nonetheless though, unless i start freezing to death
2018-07-20 00:57:28	hatshepsut	mayhaps this other outside outlet i've been eyeing doesn't go to the laundry room at all, i'll have to flip some breakers to test it tomorrow I guess
2018-07-20 00:57:52	@whitewolf	it would be very unusual for an outside outlet to share outlets with an interior outlet
2018-07-20 00:58:06	@whitewolf	given that you said trailer though, ymmv
2018-07-20 00:58:45	hatshepsut	whaddya mean
2018-07-20 00:59:02	@whitewolf	buildings of hacky construction don't always follow the rules
2018-07-20 00:59:05	hatshepsut	theres a couple different sets of 2 outlets running down the length of the house, i'm assuming they correspond to different circuits like the living room or kitchen or laundry room or what have you
2018-07-20 00:59:42	hatshepsut	one of those is what i'm plugged into now
2018-07-20 00:59:57	hatshepsut	previously i was plugged into the garage which was probably as hacky as you could get, couldn't even run the heater and microwave simultaneously without tripping the breaker
2018-07-20 01:00:41	@whitewolf	well, you want the voltage drop to be as low as possible in this situation probably
2018-07-20 01:00:50	@whitewolf	so a 12 gauge may be advised
2018-07-20 01:01:07	@whitewolf	outside outlets don't generally share inside outlet circuits
2018-07-20 01:01:24	@whitewolf	the number of breakers in the panel is the number of circuits in the loop
2018-07-20 01:01:50	hatshepsut	you mean the outside outlets would have their own circuit? like outside kitchen, outside bathroom, etc?
2018-07-20 01:02:24	@whitewolf	that may or may not be true, just that the outlets on the interior of the building are not on the same circuit as the outlets on the exterior of the building
2018-07-20 01:02:34	hatshepsut	ah
2018-07-20 01:02:52	hatshepsut	well shiet i haven't tested that
2018-07-20 01:03:00	hatshepsut	if they're all on the same circuit my plan is ruined
2018-07-20 01:03:11	@whitewolf	like i said
2018-07-20 01:03:14	@whitewolf	the breaker box answers your question
2018-07-20 01:03:32	hatshepsut	yep i'll have to play with it tomorrow
2018-07-20 01:04:27	hatshepsut	so you think 12 gauge is a better choice? is there any negatives to using that instead of 14?
2018-07-20 01:06:36	@whitewolf	not other than cost and bulk
2018-07-20 01:06:55	hatshepsut	coo

I haven't been able to get it to do that again though after another few tries.
2018-07-20 09:30:52	SadBoyGotBiqProb	wait that made no sense
2018-07-20 09:31:17	SadBoyGotBiqProb	it posted, then I put gpu in along with ssd
2018-07-20 09:31:18	@PipeItToDevNull	you still have SATA attached?
2018-07-20 09:31:22	SadBoyGotBiqProb	and that happened

2018-07-20 09:33:33	SadBoyGotBiqProb	or something
2018-07-20 09:33:51	@PipeItToDevNull	I would still look at those 2 components 
2018-07-20 09:37:15	SadBoyGotBiqProb	Yeah I'm gonna order a mobo if the psu tester tells me all is good there. mobo looks clean tho, no blown/deformed transistors or discoloration.

I checked the motherboard FAQ website (ASRock Motherboard) and it seems like there is no VGA Card detected. I am using an ASRock x370

2018-07-20 12:42:00	emperor_dragoon	yea I know, but spending 30 dollars is a lot better than having to spend 400. Which is why i am upgrading the cpu. I'll probably buy a new board and cpu in a year or so

2018-07-20 16:07:25	CoJaBo	Apache isn't usually seen as a good choice for reverse-proxying; NGINX pretty much takes that, and probably for that reason :P

2018-07-20 19:49:41	rqube	hey peeps, was just wondering if there was a way to add multiple markers to a custom google maps at once, rather than 1 address at a time
2018-07-20 19:50:16	@Mikeee	you can import a large set of coordinates
2018-07-20 19:50:51	@Mikeee	depending on the utility you're using to generate it, itll probably take a csv
2018-07-20 19:51:48	rqube	ah. so just get all the addresses line by line in a csv and then import that?
2018-07-20 19:52:18	@Mikeee	i've never seen it done by address
2018-07-20 19:52:33	@Mikeee	but you can easily convert address to coordinates using online utilities
2018-07-20 19:53:49	rqube	great! thanks heaps. is there an easy way to extract address info from a site that has pages of them? basically I'm trying to get all the addresses from insidenairobi.xemzi.com/en/hanoi/cat/341/street-food-hanoi#1/341 to just show on my maps
2018-07-20 19:56:00	@Mikeee	the maps links don't use addresses, they use coordinates
2018-07-20 19:56:34	@Mikeee	so you can write a script to extract all the coordinates on the page and then go to the next, and repeat until all are extracted
2018-07-20 19:58:04	rqube	ah ok. was hoping there might be an online tool out there to do it for me to save my lazy arse haha. thanks heaps for your help mate
2018-07-20 19:58:41	@Mikeee	not for random unpopular sites, no
2018-07-20 19:58:48	@Mikeee	but a 5 minute script could do it

2018-07-20 23:32:41	dunnousernamefn	Hey, stupid question here, does Windows 10 Home support the hot plugging of PCI(e) cards? I'm thinking of running in on a hypervisor in a desktop setup while hot swapping the single graphics card I have between the two machines.
2018-07-20 23:33:10	dunnousernamefn	I just want to know if it's going to do something like "hot-plugging is only supported on Windows Server installations"
2018-07-20 23:34:12	@whitewolf	that's more to do with your hardware 
2018-07-20 23:34:15	@whitewolf	not the version of windows
2018-07-20 23:34:20	dunnousernamefn	Okay
2018-07-20 23:34:25	@DoctorDick	Do you have a server mobo?
2018-07-20 23:34:25	@whitewolf	note that most PCIe hardware doesn't hotplug, the drivers are not ready to handle it
2018-07-20 23:34:40	dunnousernamefn	I'm using a hypervisor, so the hardware wouldn't be a problem
2018-07-20 23:35:04	@whitewolf	i promise you if your CPU chipset isn't prepared for something to drop off the bus, hypervisor or not it's going to lock up
2018-07-20 23:35:26	dunnousernamefn	oh, so the motherboard does have to support it?
2018-07-20 23:35:33	@whitewolf	... yes
2018-07-20 23:35:54	dunnousernamefn	I guess that makes sense though, otherwise the bus would be really slow if it was emulated

2018-07-20 23:40:29	dunnousernamefn	I had this idea to try and pretend I could run both windows and linux at the same time, by using a hypervisor and intercepting keybinds to switch the GPU between the two VMs
2018-07-20 23:41:30	dunnousernamefn	That's probably a bad idea on so many levels and I just don't realize it yet
2018-07-20 23:41:35	@whitewolf	meh
2018-07-20 23:41:55	@whitewolf	it's not that bad of an idea, i knew many people who used ESXi and had one VM be on-console, and then used the vSphere client to work on the other VMs
2018-07-20 23:42:04	madusa77	Haven't thrown anything out the window in a while
2018-07-20 23:42:07	@whitewolf	your idea is similar, but the guest OS needs to support hotplugging GPUs, and that's not a very popular topic

2018-07-21 08:24:37	Edward35	So a factory reset doesn't make it go away.  But I think someone involved might have been around here since one of the wi-names that popped up the same I was resetting was suspicious.

2018-07-21 08:29:46	@Swede	I have definitely seen malware alter google search results, but not regular pages. Excetpt to add popup ads.
2018-07-21 08:30:20	@Swede	this common malware injects ads into google results, and alters every damn link to add ad redirects
2018-07-21 08:30:27	Edward35	Yeah, Im pretty sure he has edited ads.  Like I saw one that says "big brother is still watching you", and others along of that, but that was a while ago.  I usually use an ad blocker.
2018-07-21 08:30:44	@Swede	stop saying "he", "they"
2018-07-21 08:30:46	@Swede	that sounds insane
2018-07-21 08:30:55	Edward35	who should i say it is then?
2018-07-21 08:31:02	@Swede	99.999% of all malware is automatically installed, malware
2018-07-21 08:31:03	Edward35	i said i think i know who it is
2018-07-21 08:31:16	@Swede	it spreads by itself. it's not "they" doing it
2018-07-21 08:31:29	@Swede	well, contact police then. it's not legal
2018-07-21 08:31:39	Edward35	Well it's just someone who knows me who is messing with me so this is completely different.
2018-07-21 08:31:58	Edward35	I shouldn't be treated like the 99.9999% if someone is targeting me specifically.
2018-07-21 08:32:14	@Swede	well if you're sure, police.
2018-07-21 08:32:16	Edward35	It's not?  Because I already did.
2018-07-21 08:32:25	Edward35	Yeah I'm sure.
2018-07-21 08:32:30	Edward35	How do you know it's illegal?
2018-07-21 08:32:50	@Swede	accessing someone elses computer without permission is illegal
2018-07-21 08:33:00	@Swede	varies how by country
2018-07-21 08:33:07	Edward35	They don't really care around here but I think the police in the town I'm in are a little better.
2018-07-21 08:33:07	Edward35	Ok.
2018-07-21 08:34:04	Edward35	Yeah, the ones I went to before were like, you just need to go to best buy, and best buy was like that's a little advanced for us, we usually just take a computer and look at it for stuff, but this is stuff affecting an entire network.
2018-07-21 08:34:10	Edward35	they said it was probably the router hacked.
2018-07-21 08:34:28	@Swede	upgrade the firmware on it
2018-07-21 08:34:35	Edward35	ok.
2018-07-21 08:34:40	Edward35	yeah i was thinking of that.
2018-07-21 08:34:40	@Swede	that removes the russian router malware that's actually real
2018-07-21 08:34:47	Edward35	this has been going on for a while.
2018-07-21 08:34:55	@Swede	even if you put the same version. it goes clean
2018-07-21 08:34:58	Edward35	i mean i am at a hotel though, so it's a different router but yeah.
2018-07-21 08:36:36	Edward35	the stuff is on my sisters network at her house, but not on her neighbors when i checked with a new device.  so i don't get it, it's like it's spreading everywhere, and the only place i cant see it is some random person's wifi.  i don't know if it's like a worm or what.
2018-07-21 08:37:54	Edward35	Someone is being manipulative, I mean I go places and see weird wi-fi names that looks like they have to do with the stuff they put on my pc, but i was in this hotel for 5 days and the first time i saw it here was right after i did the factory reset.
2018-07-21 08:38:16	Edward35	so if i have someone following me and messing with me like that and I tell people I know I sound a little off
2018-07-21 08:38:17	@Swede	crazy talk again...
2018-07-21 08:38:26	Edward35	But they can do it, right?
2018-07-21 08:38:26	@Swede	Do you see what I mean by that?
2018-07-21 08:38:43	@Swede	why? theres no profit in harrassing you specifically
2018-07-21 08:38:50	Edward35	That's what I said, it's manipulative, because they are doing that, and I know it sound crazy.
2018-07-21 08:39:08	Edward35	Some people do enjoy it though.
2018-07-21 08:39:21	Edward35	i mean, especially if you are an easy target
2018-07-21 08:39:35	@Swede	some people would be capable. But those ppl tend to spend their time making $1000 per day online
2018-07-21 08:39:41	Edward35	they've gotten away with it for a long time?
2018-07-21 08:40:50	Edward35	that wasn't meant to be a question, anyway.  but yeah, there are people out there who enjoy frustrating other people and messing with them.  if they're bored and don't have much going on, who knows.
2018-07-21 08:41:01	Edward35	I keep to myself a lot, so I didn't have many sources to help me.
2018-07-21 08:41:22	@Swede	if there's no motive, then it's not happening
2018-07-21 08:41:37	Edward35	Then there has to be a motive.
2018-07-21 08:41:50	@Swede	ok... someone hates you?
2018-07-21 08:42:01	@Swede	also you said you know who it is
2018-07-21 08:42:09	Edward35	I don't make up stories like that.  I can think of lots of reasons.
2018-07-21 08:43:30	Edward35	Yeah, I know someone good with computers and is a programmer and knows a lot about hacking, etc.  Lots of the stuff they put on my internet looks like a hint it was him. Personality-wise is definitely the type of person to do it.
2018-07-21 08:43:56	Edward35	Also he was giving me hints it was him when I messaged him on facebook.
2018-07-21 08:44:04	Edward35	Many times.
2018-07-21 08:44:20	@Swede	ok good, police time
2018-07-21 08:44:27	Edward35	Yeah.
2018-07-21 08:44:38	@Swede	collect the evidence
2018-07-21 08:44:44	Edward35	the bar at the bottom down below keeps flashing, the task bar
2018-07-21 08:45:15	Edward35	I'm pretty sure "he/they" do that
2018-07-21 08:45:36	Edward35	so i guess it is not just internet stuff
2018-07-21 08:45:55	Edward35	that type of stuff and like changing my cursor can't really be proof.  it did it again.
2018-07-21 08:46:10	Edward35	but i have pictures and videos.
2018-07-21 08:47:24	@Swede	and convos with the guy
2018-07-21 08:47:57	Edward35	yeah, those convos probably make me sound crazy at first, but that was sort of the point.
2018-07-21 08:48:15	Edward35	although anyone smart would know if i got any weird ideas about first about what was going on it was planted
2018-07-21 08:48:25	Edward35	i mean i was manipulated
2018-07-21 08:49:48	Edward35	I have medication sensitivities and that caught me at a bad time, because  as soon as I took something I was having thinking problems until it wore off, but honestly the stuff he/they was done to mess with me and make me think it was all sorts of different people at first
2018-07-21 08:50:43	Edward35	I can see how it is funny for people to get people thinking stuff and confusing them.
2018-07-21 08:51:01	Edward35	the guy likes to mess with people like that

2018-07-21 08:56:26	Edward35	and i don't really know if the police are going to help me or not, I've tried three different times, and even different towns
2018-07-21 08:56:52	Edward35	they said someone needed to have physical access to my computer to do that stuff, and told me i had to have handed my computer over?
2018-07-21 08:57:04	Edward35	i don't think the woman i talked to knows anything at all about computers.
2018-07-21 08:57:32	Edward35	i got yelled at for a lot of stuff by them.  like i said, the woman just told me to go to best buy and I pretty much heard it wasn't a big deal.
2018-07-21 08:57:58	Edward35	rest my computer*** not router
2018-07-21 08:58:06	Edward35	reset***
2018-07-21 08:58:53	Edward35	they said i should go to the FBI lmao
2018-07-21 08:59:09	Edward35	which i did because why not, if a cop tells me that, why shouldn't I
2018-07-21 08:59:52	Edward35	then the Wi-Fi names are FBI Van and Stalker wherever I go when I check the list of Wi-Fis to connect to which sounds like a coincidence but it isn't.
2018-07-21 09:00:54	Edward35	It happened again right after I reset my pc and the first time I checked the wi-fi list one of those things popped up after being in this hotel room for 5 days and not seeing that stuff.

2018-07-21 09:19:56	Edward35	So what do you think is going on if it's still there after a reset at a hotel?  They hacked the router at the hotel?  It sounded like some sort of man in the middle attack where my internet traffic is being rerouted still?
2018-07-21 09:20:13	Digitalbks	So, an unnamed program is using up all of my CPU. And I've no idea how to fix it, can anyone help?
2018-07-21 09:20:26	Edward35	These people are sort of obessed with me for some reason.  they might have gotten a room in the hotel and got the wifi password, plus i think they can hear through my phone.

2018-07-21 09:37:55	desgen	I'd say maybe the 80's and then on it stopped being so friendly, and more full of shit

2018-07-21 09:41:52	Edward35	explain?

2018-07-21 09:42:06	desgen	this is the most fun one
2018-07-21 09:42:11	desgen	so I am guessing that one.
2018-07-21 09:42:14	Edward35	Well...there are lots of suicide jokes on my computer.
2018-07-21 09:42:23	Edward35	And I did feel like someone was trying to get me to do that at first.
2018-07-21 09:42:35	desgen	well, there you go, you have someone trying to basically legally murder you.
2018-07-21 09:42:43	Edward35	Then they started putting lighthouses and lifeguard towers, etc, stuff like that everywhere.
2018-07-21 09:43:24	Edward35	They kept editing my thumbnails of on youtube but I wasn't sure if they did this one or not but there was on that said suicide watch squad or something then they put it up there again like a year later.
2018-07-21 09:43:52	Edward35	Right after I was I figured out the meaning of those lighthouses, watch tower, life guard towers, etc...

2018-07-21 09:44:51	Edward35	Yeah I have wireshark.
2018-07-21 09:44:59	desgen	ok, you need a capture of it.
2018-07-21 09:45:01	Edward35	or i did until i reset my pc
2018-07-21 09:45:12	desgen	there went that then
2018-07-21 09:45:23	Edward35	What?
2018-07-21 09:45:23	desgen	just do it anyway, but maybe bait him
2018-07-21 09:45:35	desgen	well, he probably knows of your conversation by now
2018-07-21 09:45:45	Edward35	Yeah well he can see what I'm doing, he knows everything.
2018-07-21 09:46:05	Edward35	He also put spy cameras in the house and got some nice neighbors next to watch me (suicide watch squad)
2018-07-21 09:46:17	Edward35	next door*
2018-07-21 09:46:19	Edward35	they are nice
2018-07-21 09:46:32	desgen	Ok, well, you can't do anything about this, im sorry.
2018-07-21 09:46:41	Edward35	Why not?
2018-07-21 09:47:12	desgen	I'm not sure, there has to be some conclusion behind it im not knowing, go find the conclusion, and obtain it as your own.
2018-07-21 09:47:29	Edward35	Incoherent
2018-07-21 09:47:35	Edward35	conclusion?
2018-07-21 09:47:53	desgen	Go speak to them.
2018-07-21 09:48:05	desgen	Or call the police.
2018-07-21 09:48:08	desgen	there are 2 things.
2018-07-21 09:48:14	desgen	two solutions
2018-07-21 09:48:21	Edward35	I already did on facebook.  He said " I don't have access to your computer and you need a new one or something"
2018-07-21 09:48:45	desgen	That sounds like he's taking advantage of a firmware flaw, or exploit.
2018-07-21 09:49:04	desgen	or microcode, but I don't know what you can do about it.
2018-07-21 09:49:16	Edward35	but if they are just doing it through the routers wherever I go, how does buying a new computer help?  I'm going to end up homeless since I have no money and little support and its hard for me to find and work, even minimum wage.
2018-07-21 09:49:31	Edward35	microcode, ugh

2018-07-21 09:49:58	Edward35	Well...they put that stuff on the university library computers.
2018-07-21 09:50:31	Edward35	I live with my mom and as soon as mentioned my computer being hacked she yelled at me that she was going to send me to a hospital for the severely mentally insane.
2018-07-21 09:50:47	Edward35	Then they started putting stuff over my computer and devices everywhere that they heard my mom say this.
2018-07-21 09:50:56	desgen	It basically doesn't matter what you do, but just know you can do something, and it isn't suicide.
2018-07-21 09:51:22	Edward35	Then, there is stuff about hospitalization everywhere. Like they give me hints they heard the conversation.
2018-07-21 09:51:31	@Swede	it's possible this is all general, mass malware. It's also possible it's all in your head.
2018-07-21 09:51:35	Edward35	Then I am getting lots of death threats on top of this sporadically.
2018-07-21 09:51:53	Edward35	So I am getting scared for my life, and they did this while I was sick.
2018-07-21 09:52:02	desgen	I'd like to learn about this stuff, actually, mainly the thing is you could is talk to them, like go up and talk to them, you basically have to be a man.
2018-07-21 09:52:18	Edward35	I already messaged him.
2018-07-21 09:52:25	@Swede	go "what the hell do you want"
2018-07-21 09:52:33	@Swede	meet him.
2018-07-21 09:52:37	desgen	It's ok, you'll be fine.
2018-07-21 09:52:40	Edward35	Then I started yelling at my mom because she wouldn't help me or take me anywhere and I didn't have any resources to help myself.
2018-07-21 09:53:01	Edward35	So I got scared enough that I started yelling violently, and ended up walking across the street with my shoes off after I got a rape threat.
2018-07-21 09:53:20	desgen	lol a rape threat?
2018-07-21 09:53:24	Edward35	So the cops in this tiny house town I'm in think I'm crazy and everyone wants me to be hospitalized all of a sudden.
2018-07-21 09:53:25	Edward35	Yeah.
2018-07-21 09:53:55	Edward35	And the drugs I was on, psych meds almost killed me because I was too sensitive to them.  I'm probably the most sensitive person in the world to drugs.
2018-07-21 09:54:07	Edward35	So they awnt me to be hospitalized and go to a place.
2018-07-21 09:54:22	desgen	That seems like the same situation exactly for me.
2018-07-21 09:54:28	desgen	I'm going to be honest.
2018-07-21 09:54:32	desgen	But, im not having it.
2018-07-21 09:54:35	Edward35	And I am scared for my life, because I know how I react on psych meds.  I was off of them for 4 years and doing fine until this.
2018-07-21 09:54:36	desgen	is the cool thing.
2018-07-21 09:54:59	Edward35	So they want me to go somewhere I'm going to die.
2018-07-21 09:55:02	Edward35	I have suicide jokes on my computer.
2018-07-21 09:55:13	desgen	ok, where?
2018-07-21 09:55:15	Edward35	They humiliated me and tried to get me to kill myself from the looks of it.
2018-07-21 09:55:23	desgen	show me, personally.
2018-07-21 09:55:24	Edward35	Long story, don't feel like giving details.
2018-07-21 09:55:29	Edward35	No thank you.
2018-07-21 09:55:52	desgen	ok, well, im obligated to do something about this, so im keeeping your IP address for future reference.
2018-07-21 09:55:55	Edward35	I have stuff that looks like they think it's funny to put stuff on my computer to scare me.
2018-07-21 09:55:59	Edward35	Ok.
2018-07-21 09:56:15	Edward35	You're not a mod in this room though?
2018-07-21 09:56:57	Edward35	Then I did end up in a hospital because I was outside in the yard crying about it, and my mom called the cops on me after I hit her or something.
2018-07-21 09:57:25	Edward35	Ended up on some bad medication that gave me diabetes before and made me really paranoid.  Haven't felt paranoid really since I stopped takingit and figured out who did all of this.
2018-07-21 09:57:41	Edward35	Since I have a paradoxical reaction to everything.
2018-07-21 09:58:01	desgen	I know all about it, what is it you want done, is the question?
2018-07-21 09:58:07	@Swede	desgen is a trusted helper. don't know why he isn't op
2018-07-21 09:58:17	Edward35	ok
2018-07-21 09:58:26	desgen	What do you want done.
2018-07-21 09:58:57	Edward35	Probably get rid of the fake stuff on my computer since it's on other devices and i saved a lot of stuff on a external hard disk.

2018-07-21 10:07:46	Edward35	the Russian router hack article reminded me of the stuff they did though, that's why i figured it was a router hack when everyone was saying you just have a RAT
2018-07-21 10:07:49	desgen	Just, sit back and watch the news, I guess?
2018-07-21 10:08:10	@Swede	the router hack is not known to alter content
2018-07-21 10:08:24	@Swede	it's known to disable https: for eavesdropping though
2018-07-21 10:08:32	desgen	It's used for opening access to a RAT, if need be
2018-07-21 10:08:34	Edward35	The article I read about it said it does.  Really?
2018-07-21 10:08:42	Edward35	oh, thank you.
2018-07-21 10:08:48	@Swede	and like most malware it spreads itself, it's not by human action
2018-07-21 10:09:09	Edward35	so if they have access to the wifi, can they just immediately install the rat on my computer?
2018-07-21 10:09:13	@Swede	so there's no target except "the west"
2018-07-21 10:09:22	Edward35	as soon as i reset?
2018-07-21 10:09:31	Edward35	How do they alter content then?
2018-07-21 10:11:24	Edward35	like if someone likes to do something they think is funny like plant fake articles about Justin Bieber everywhere or something like that
2018-07-21 10:11:33	Edward35	that's what im saying it is a lot silly fake news lol
2018-07-21 10:12:22	Edward35	is it just a dns spoof or something else going on?
2018-07-21 10:14:00	Edward35	Don't understand why I can never get a clear answer on any of this stuff.
2018-07-21 10:14:25	desgen	You basically can't prevent it, just let the economy collapse I guess
2018-07-21 10:15:05	Edward35	I saw a video on motherboard and it showed someone planting a fake article on some sites.  I guess they said the traffic was rerouted through their own server so they could edit it that way.  But I still don't understand if it's a dns spoof or something else.
2018-07-21 10:15:49	desgen	A dns spoof? I don't think they're that stupid to have that easily visable exploit get seen.
2018-07-21 10:16:15	desgen	But, who knows, they can do what they want better, when they go deeper.
2018-07-21 10:16:17	Edward35	Well how is it obvious?  Because i don't know still.
2018-07-21 10:17:03	desgen	I'd assume if you go deeper on a hardware level, you will be able to spoof whatever the hell you want without viable means of finding out "what's happening"
2018-07-21 10:17:21	Edward35	yeah
2018-07-21 10:17:39	Edward35	so i shouldn't even bother taking it to a repair shop then?  Just more waste of money?
2018-07-21 10:17:48	desgen	Hell, if you can tell something to ignore the output or logging of something
2018-07-21 10:17:54	desgen	you'd just be basically fucked, and thats it.
2018-07-21 10:18:03	Edward35	not understanding but ok
2018-07-21 10:18:04	desgen	can you find out? Go find out, that'd be great.
2018-07-21 10:18:11	Edward35	no..
2018-07-21 10:18:29	Edward35	these guys do not come off as geniuses...
2018-07-21 10:18:43	Edward35	they're messing around with me when i was at the hospital.
2018-07-21 10:19:00	desgen	Can you caluclate intelligence when you have 1,000,000+ other heads?
2018-07-21 10:19:38	desgen	No.
2018-07-21 10:19:42	desgen	Now, end of discussion
2018-07-21 10:19:43	Edward35	right before they did all that stuff to upset me to get me in there, i was posting about the hospital they were most likely to send me to.  I said "the hospital lets pretty much anyone end and there are homeless people who go there just get a meal"
2018-07-21 10:19:53	Edward35	there's not 1 million heads involved.
2018-07-21 10:20:02	Edward35	it does appear ther are lots of local people involved though.
2018-07-21 10:20:13	Edward35	and i don't live in a hugely populated area
2018-07-21 10:20:30	desgen	Ok, neither do a lot of other people?
2018-07-21 10:20:58	Edward35	so for some reason a lot of local people are involved even though this guy lives 10 hours away who is the main person involved?

2018-07-21 10:42:15	+markasoftware	the malware can control what that button does
2018-07-21 10:42:38	+markasoftware	sorry if someone else mentioned this already
2018-07-21 10:42:53	Edward35	thanks for that.
2018-07-21 10:43:02	Edward35	how do i factory reset it then.  i need a disk?
2018-07-21 10:43:11	+markasoftware	yes
2018-07-21 10:43:13	+markasoftware	or a usb
2018-07-21 10:43:18	+markasoftware	use a different computer to make the usb
2018-07-21 10:43:23	Edward35	that's sort of what i considered to.
2018-07-21 10:43:39	Edward35	do i need to buy another copy of windows
2018-07-21 10:43:44	+markasoftware	no
2018-07-21 10:43:49	+markasoftware	do you know your product key?
2018-07-21 10:43:56	+markasoftware	there might be a sticker with the code on your computer somewhere
2018-07-21 10:44:22	+markasoftware	go on a different Windos computer, use the Media Creation Tool to create a new usb
2018-07-21 10:44:29	+markasoftware	even if you don't know your key, you can use the free trial for 30 days
2018-07-21 10:44:41	desgen	It's not going to matter if his actual integrity is comprimised.
2018-07-21 10:45:20	+markasoftware	what do you mean by that?
2018-07-21 10:45:51	desgen	I'm saying, if he's effected as much as he says.
2018-07-21 10:45:59	desgen	"Buy a new computer, idk lol"
2018-07-21 10:46:12	desgen	this directly suggests something is still wrong with the PC, itself
2018-07-21 10:46:23	desgen	either trolling you, or not
2018-07-21 10:46:25	+markasoftware	If it doesn't seem like a "generic" virus, like it's targeted at you specifically, you should just call the police
2018-07-21 10:46:29	desgen	regardless, he knows too much
2018-07-21 10:46:46	desgen	and probably will continue regardless of a new PC
2018-07-21 10:46:53	desgen	right away, he'll be like
2018-07-21 10:47:00	desgen	"Bitch please, you're making it a little hard"
2018-07-21 10:47:07	desgen	"Comming at you double dose now"
2018-07-21 10:47:32	Edward35	already called. in a different town now though.
2018-07-21 10:47:37	desgen	ok

2018-07-21 10:47:47	desgen	and, if you're this gang
2018-07-21 10:47:50	desgen	god speed
2018-07-21 10:48:01	Edward35	yeah that's why i don't understand if he is trolling
2018-07-21 10:48:32	Edward35	a year and a half ago he did mention router firmware and that if i was seeing something others weren't seeing than its the dns is changed of the site
2018-07-21 10:48:36	desgen	lol, sorry charly. Anyway, I can't really say much else, do you have an actual question I can address
2018-07-21 10:48:44	desgen	I refuse to comment on more statements
2018-07-21 10:48:45	Edward35	but he was trolling and getting me to think stuff that wasn't true so how do i know?
2018-07-21 10:49:14	+markasoftware	Edward35: so some websites are modified hen you visit them?
2018-07-21 10:49:18	desgen	Edward35: You proivde proof, proof with what you know behind likely suspects.
2018-07-21 10:49:53	desgen	I myself have one major criminal busted, likely.
2018-07-21 10:49:55	Edward35	i wondered if it was some internet group like on 4chan or the like too but im not too familiar with that site
2018-07-21 10:50:04	Edward35	it seemed like lots of people were watching me
2018-07-21 10:50:12	desgen	He is part of this gang, or may be, or pretends to be, or likes the shit he does.
2018-07-21 10:50:35	desgen	Anyway, I have one major criminal con man in prison, about to be, or somewhere
2018-07-21 10:50:38	desgen	for many many years
2018-07-21 10:50:50	desgen	it will also probably serve justified reason for the death penalty 
2018-07-21 10:51:02	desgen	so, he will get it really hard and good.
2018-07-21 10:51:31	desgen	This man isn't Trump or a leader of sorts
2018-07-21 10:51:39	desgen	he's a wolf, a wolf of wall street.
2018-07-21 10:51:50	desgen	and not anyone here, I hope, but no, i don't think so.
2018-07-21 10:52:08	desgen	This Karl, I mentioned him before, many times.
2018-07-21 10:52:21	desgen	Yes, Karl, him, will be busted because reasons of some sort.
2018-07-21 10:52:29	desgen	And it'll be really bad.

I understand they can't make more public keys without access to your private key file, but if they jsut take your public key, isn't it no different than stealing your password?
2018-07-21 10:57:35	newbiessss	Is it just one extra layer of protection? Essential having a "physical password" in addition to a digital one?

2018-07-21 12:17:38	@Swede	the manual (free download) explains how to use it
2018-07-21 12:18:21	ABeeinSpace	What computer is it?

2018-07-21 12:19:00	@Swede	yeah. it will have a restore partition

2018-07-21 12:21:21	@DoctorDick	You can just use the Windows 8 Media Creation Tool to create a Windows 8 flash drive and reinstall using that

2018-07-21 12:21:37	@DoctorDick	The key is bound to the hardware so you can just click the skip key button
2018-07-21 12:21:53	@Swede	is Windows 8 still downloadable?
2018-07-21 12:21:58	@DoctorDick	Yep
2018-07-21 12:22:06	@DoctorDick	I might be an iso though
2018-07-21 12:22:15	@Swede	but the restore will give him all the lenovo drivers
2018-07-21 12:22:19	@DoctorDick	So you might need to use Rufus + that .iso
2018-07-21 12:22:21	@Swede	it's a far easier option
2018-07-21 12:22:29	@DoctorDick	I'd just download the latest on Lenovo's site
2018-07-21 12:22:46	ABeeinSpace	Whats the issue?
2018-07-21 12:23:15	@DoctorDick	It also remove all the Lenovo bloatware
2018-07-21 12:23:34	ABeeinSpace	True
2018-07-21 12:23:36	@Swede	yesbut, it's guaranteed to work with no addons to do

2018-07-21 14:16:04	Ziggy463	I mean the low fps. And does it happen in other games?
2018-07-21 14:16:28	Seafu	I don't really play other games and most games I do play don't have an ingame benchmark

2018-07-21 14:41:25	Seafu	Alright I'm back. This time I got a minimum of 7fps. But I had Task Manager open this time and my CPU Usage is quite often hitting 100%. Any idea why that is? It's also staying in the high 90% for most of the bench marking
2018-07-21 14:41:48	@DoctorDick	If your CPU is hitting 100%, then it's bottlenecking

2018-07-21 14:46:03	Ziggy463	Run a benchmark in 1440p or 2160p and see if the fps is better. I know this sounds backwards, but I think your cpu is taking the hit because of the low res
2018-07-21 14:46:05	Seafu	much less if I own them

Try one at a time and test so if you need to change the settings back its easy to remember. It's worth a shot since ubisoft is not recognizing the issue.

One says "The Open Procedure for service "BITS" in DLL "C:\Windows\System32\bitsperf.dll" failed. Performance data for this service will not be available. The first four bytes (DWORD) of the Data section contains the error code."
2018-07-21 17:08:14	duckmann	The other says "Windows cannot load the extensible counter DLL rdyboost. The first four bytes (DWORD) of the Data section contains the Windows error code." What exactly does this mean?

2018-07-21 17:11:35	duckmann	First time it ever happened with Far Cry 5, but it's the only game I have that it has had trouble with before. On occasion, depending on what I'm doing in game, the screen will stop for a full 1/2-1 second and just resume at 60-80fps, but it doesn't show the FPS ever dropped.

2018-07-21 18:48:03	@PipeItToDevNull	Piggythedog, I am pretty sure you are confusing "storage" and "backups"

2018-07-21 18:50:31	@PipeItToDevNull	What are you backing up

2018-07-21 18:52:07	@PipeItToDevNull	Not a backup 
2018-07-21 18:52:10	@PipeItToDevNull	That is a cache 
2018-07-21 18:52:22	@PipeItToDevNull	A backup, implies the data exists in 2 places 
2018-07-21 18:52:33	@PipeItToDevNull	Most preferably not in the same machine 
2018-07-21 18:52:45	Piggythedog	its a external hard drive

2018-07-21 18:53:22	@PipeItToDevNull	It cant be used for fuze, and backup 
2018-07-21 18:53:35	Piggythedog	sorry i'm confused right now.
2018-07-21 18:53:53	Piggythedog	I can't back up the my hard drives onto a external hard drive
2018-07-21 18:54:00	Piggythedog	then install the fuzedrive?

2018-07-21 18:54:48	@PipeItToDevNull	If you are saying multiple drives exist, and you are not using the external, that is fine. But "Storage" and "Backup" are not official terms. They are one and the same because everything is data
2018-07-21 18:55:35	@PipeItToDevNull	But this is just a slow RAID0
2018-07-21 18:55:54	@PipeItToDevNull	This looks like the next "Hybrid-Drive" gimmick 
2018-07-21 18:56:41	Piggythedog	It works apparently

2018-07-21 19:01:05	@PipeItToDevNull	"backups" are just data, just like pictures 
2018-07-21 19:01:15	@PipeItToDevNull	There is nothing inherently different about data you call a backup 
2018-07-21 19:01:33	@PipeItToDevNull	but, where are you backing the pictures up to?

2018-07-21 19:03:14	Piggythedog	that why i can just move everything form the SD to the external WD

2018-07-22 00:37:20	@Mikeee	You can copy steam games
2018-07-22 00:37:44	@Mikeee	since steam handles licensing and installation
2018-07-22 00:37:54	@Mikeee	use the backup/restore option for it
2018-07-22 00:38:01	@Mikeee	basically everything else... no.
2018-07-22 00:38:25	oooof	that's what I was worried about :< the other programs are pretty large and take a while to install

2018-07-22 07:53:07	Errroneous	Hi all, I thought I would give this a crack and see if there is anyone that can help me please.
2018-07-22 07:53:28	Errroneous	In my very limit knowledge of how this works 'm chasing so help please. for some reason (user error) I backed up my wife's iPhone tonight with a freshly restored IPhone.  (in other words - the back up of her phone I did this morning was cleared as I backed it up again). the problem was that I backed it up with phone that had been factory reset - so
2018-07-22 07:53:28	Errroneous	 in otherwords no data. Now to make matters worse my computer was filling with data so I had to deleted somme files and deleted the earlier back up from the A/appdata/ file. I have since tried to muck around and restore from back up but the restore I did was actually back to factory reset or the latest back up. I have perm deleted these files as we
2018-07-22 07:53:28	Errroneous	ll as created about 200gb of new restores and deleted these also. is there anyway that I can search for a backup created about 12 hours ago that I already deleted from the rubbish bin?
2018-07-22 07:55:23	Seafu	if I am not mistaken if it's gone from the recycle bin then it's gone for good short of forensic level recovery
2018-07-22 07:55:46	@Eisenstein	Seafu: your GPU temp never gets above 63C or so but the fan goes berserk
2018-07-22 07:55:59	Errroneous	damn! thanks for that

2018-07-22 08:03:54	@Eisenstein	Seafu: I don't know, these logs are huge and I don't feel like sifting through all the data.  If the GPU fan is going crazy then either 1) the thermal control isn't reading the fan's RPMs properly and thus runs it at max and shuts down when it thinks the fan has failed 2) thermal control is not reading temp properly 3) something heatsink is loose
2018-07-22 08:04:09	@Eisenstein	4) fan is going bad
2018-07-22 08:04:37	Seafu	lol well is there something I can get you that will narrow it down?
2018-07-22 08:04:57	@Eisenstein	open the machine and make sure the heatsink is not clogged / loose; make sure fan spins freely when the machine is turned off and you give it a nudge
2018-07-22 08:05:25	Seafu	Which fan? I have a bunch of them
2018-07-22 08:05:34	@Eisenstein	one little push should make the blades spin around a couple times
2018-07-22 08:05:38	@Eisenstein	try them all

2018-07-22 10:11:19	gozieson	What do you think?

2018-07-22 11:47:04	gozieson	It's not the external seagate disk?

2018-07-22 11:47:17	@DoctorDick	Yep
2018-07-22 11:47:34	gozieson	So how could i deal with it?
2018-07-22 11:47:39	@DoctorDick	Replace it
2018-07-22 11:47:44	@DoctorDick	And then reinstall Windows
2018-07-22 11:48:35	gozieson	I would have to transfer the data though, is that right?
2018-07-22 11:48:43	@DoctorDick	Like what?
2018-07-22 11:48:50	gozieson	Also, what if it's because there's not much room left in the SSD?
2018-07-22 11:49:04	gozieson	I've got 7GB out of the 128 left
2018-07-22 11:49:06	@whitewolf	that certainly doesn't help it
2018-07-22 11:49:11	@whitewolf	it means that it will struggle to wear level
2018-07-22 11:49:16	@DoctorDick	Yeah you should keep about 20% free space
2018-07-22 11:49:33	@whitewolf	a 256/512G ssd is a lot more affordable now
2018-07-22 11:49:52	@whitewolf	prices can be found below 50 cents a gig
2018-07-22 11:50:20	gozieson	Should be easy to replace in a dell Inspiron right?
2018-07-22 11:50:23	gozieson	One-screw and all
2018-07-22 11:50:30	@DoctorDick	And the newer NVMe drives are way faster than your current one
2018-07-22 11:50:38	@DoctorDick	Depends on the model I guess
2018-07-22 11:50:54	@whitewolf	should be pretty straightforward
2018-07-22 11:51:26	gozieson	Quick question, how do you route all installations to drive D
2018-07-22 11:51:34	gozieson	some apps are still auto installing to drive C
2018-07-22 11:52:11	@DoctorDick	What's D:?
2018-07-22 11:52:15	@DoctorDick	Your external drive?
2018-07-22 11:52:43	gozieson	I have an SSD and a 500 GB HDD built in
2018-07-22 11:52:50	gozieson	D is the built in HDD
2018-07-22 11:53:03	@DoctorDick	Change the default path in the registry
2018-07-22 11:53:05	@whitewolf	in general you'll want to install programs onto the SSD
2018-07-22 11:53:14	@whitewolf	you're getting a bigger one anyway ;)
2018-07-22 11:53:21	gozieson	uh...
2018-07-22 11:53:23	gozieson	ok
2018-07-22 11:53:41	@whitewolf	no seriously, keep bulk media and things that don't benefit from the SSD on the HDD
2018-07-22 11:54:07	@whitewolf	also, let's have you run a hwinfo64 just to make sure there's no other obvious hardware problem

2018-07-22 12:01:05	@whitewolf	that's interesting
2018-07-22 12:01:20	@whitewolf	have you reset your chrome profile and uninstalled/disabled all extensions?
2018-07-22 12:01:25	@DoctorDick	assbaring69, What about Safari?
2018-07-22 12:01:30	@DoctorDick	Does that open wiki fine?
2018-07-22 12:01:32	@whitewolf	that's also a good point
2018-07-22 12:01:59	assbaring69	hang on, @DoctorDick, trying now
2018-07-22 12:02:07	assbaring69	yes it does

2018-07-22 12:02:34	assbaring69	how to reset chrome profile? what does it do? i don't want to delete anything i can't get back
2018-07-22 12:02:44	@DoctorDick	Or try Chrome in incognito mode without any extentions
2018-07-22 12:03:17	assbaring69	oh wtf, yeah incognito works fine
2018-07-22 12:03:28	assbaring69	what do you think is causing this then?
2018-07-22 12:03:36	@whitewolf	an extension 
2018-07-22 12:03:36	@DoctorDick	Disable all your extensions
2018-07-22 12:03:44	@DoctorDick	Then enable them one by one and check
2018-07-22 12:03:45	@Swede	assbaring69: can you open the main page and it stays on that url? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
2018-07-22 12:03:45	@TechSupport	Title: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
2018-07-22 12:03:55	@Swede	hit ctrl-F5 on it
2018-07-22 12:04:15	assbaring69	nah, so far, there's no "error" page or anything. it just stays on loading a blank page and the blue circle swirling
2018-07-22 12:04:23	assbaring69	for the tab
2018-07-22 12:06:36	assbaring69	yeah i don't think disabling the extensions is changing anything
2018-07-22 12:07:07	@Swede	does Esc on the page keep the url?
2018-07-22 12:07:24	assbaring69	what do you mean?
2018-07-22 12:07:44	@Swede	open the page. Wait a bit. Hit esc
2018-07-22 12:07:47	@Swede	is the url gone?
2018-07-22 12:08:01	@Swede	if it's still there, do Ctrl+F5
2018-07-22 12:08:25	@DoctorDick	assbaring69, Did you disable the extensions and then restart Chrome?
2018-07-22 12:08:40	assbaring69	oh no
2018-07-22 12:08:43	assbaring69	url bar stays the same
2018-07-22 12:08:51	assbaring69	i tried ctrl+f5, nothing
2018-07-22 12:08:55	@DoctorDick	Disable all extensions and then restart Chrome
2018-07-22 12:08:59	assbaring69	but i can try restarting chrome
2018-07-22 12:09:08	assbaring69	how do i get back on this chat though
2018-07-22 12:09:20	@DoctorDick	With Safari
2018-07-22 12:09:33	@Swede	ctrl-shift-T reopens all tabs
2018-07-22 12:09:42	@Swede	no, really it does
2018-07-22 12:09:53	assbaring69	will it automatically get back on this exact thread?
2018-07-22 12:10:23	@Swede	don't know. this isn't a thread though

2018-07-22 12:21:00	@DoctorDick	Also disable all extensions

2018-07-22 13:59:13	CoJaBo	radioactivegator: You might need to register your nick, there's instructions on the freenode.net site
2018-07-22 13:59:27	Lucas	i'll try get a photo but it is a bit unpredictable
2018-07-22 13:59:51	radioactivegator	I coudln't get into the python chat so here goes:   The line for x in range(2, n):  when n=2   What is x?
2018-07-22 13:59:54	CoJaBo	Is it a laptop or desktop?
2018-07-22 14:00:33	Lucas	macbook air
2018-07-22 14:00:40	radioactivegator	Wouldn't that be range 2,1?
2018-07-22 14:01:24	CoJaBo	IIRC, range() just generates an array of the values in that range
2018-07-22 14:01:36	CoJaBo	Look it up in the manual for what the args actually mean
2018-07-22 14:02:05	radioactivegator	Yeah I know, but the range (1,5) would be 1 up to 4 and not include 5
2018-07-22 14:02:37	radioactivegator	So range 2,2 would not include 2
2018-07-22 14:02:41	radioactivegator	there would be no range
2018-07-22 14:03:32	CoJaBo	Then it'd return an empty array (empty set), and the loop gets skiped altogether
2018-07-22 14:03:41	radioactivegator	OK
2018-07-22 14:03:44	radioactivegator	Thanks

2018-07-22 14:05:07	CoJaBo	Are the menus skewed too?
2018-07-22 14:05:07	Lucas	can you see that? so i was playing a fullscreen video and after a while it flicks to looking like that
2018-07-22 14:05:18	Lucas	if i move the mouse it goes back to normal
2018-07-22 14:05:27	Lucas	then if i leave the mouse alone it jumps back slanted
2018-07-22 14:05:57	CoJaBo	Might be a browser bug; almost sounds like it's skewing only when the menu isn't present
2018-07-22 14:06:11	Lucas	menus.. like the play/pause button and progress bar? you can't see them cos it only goes like that when the mouse isn't moved and nothing is open
2018-07-22 14:06:15	CoJaBo	Try it in a different browser maybe?
2018-07-22 14:06:15	Lucas	yeah i think you're right
2018-07-22 14:06:17	Lucas	it is so strange
2018-07-22 14:06:58	Lucas	I wonder if it is a chrome add-on messing things up
2018-07-22 14:07:41	CoJaBo	It's possible; trying it in Firefox or Safari would tell you if it's related to browser/addons or not

2018-07-22 14:13:27	Lucas	becuase it is only in proper fullscreen where it happens
2018-07-22 14:13:34	CoJaBo	I mean the aspect ratio of the video itself
2018-07-22 14:13:47	Lucas	ohh
2018-07-22 14:13:54	Lucas	to be honest i think it only happens in vertical videos
2018-07-22 14:13:59	CoJaBo	My screen issue was affected by how much of the screen was black on the edges
2018-07-22 14:14:01	Lucas	you know when filmed on a phone and they hold it wrong

2018-07-22 14:14:10	Lucas	exactly
2018-07-22 14:14:17	Lucas	it doesn't happen with all videos
2018-07-22 14:14:22	Lucas	only if they have lots of black on the side
2018-07-22 14:15:09	CoJaBo	Try playing one of those in a media player; see if it does the same

2018-07-22 14:18:38	Lucas	and it let me download
2018-07-22 14:19:02	CoJaBo	I'd probably still try Firefox just in case it's something in common with chrome and safari that's broken, but that doesn't seem likely.. If it was something with the video acceleration/decosing (or even hardware), it should affect the media player too
2018-07-22 14:20:06	CoJaBo	As a work-around, you can use youtube-dl to download from most sites (not just youtube, despite the name) and just play them offline, tho obviously that doesn't really fix the underlying issue

2018-07-22 14:22:20	Paul_Langton	Using an XPS 15 9560. Bought an Amazon basics usb-c dongle to plug in ethernet and add some usb 3.0 ports. Everything worked fine will using the dongle in conjunction with usb 3.0 wireless headphones or aux headphones. Randomly today, my sound won't play at all with the usb-c dongle plugged in. This includes with either set of headphones plugged in
2018-07-22 14:22:20	Paul_Langton	 or even the laptop speakers, so I'm guessing my laptop is recognizing the dongle as headphones or something.
2018-07-22 14:22:56	Lucas	downloaded and checked firefox. it doesn't happen there.
2018-07-22 14:22:59	Lucas	plays just fine.
2018-07-22 14:23:35	Lucas	i mean it isn't such a huge problem. it has been happening for a quite a while but is only on the occasional video. i'm a bit lazy at fixing technical problems.
2018-07-22 14:23:45	CoJaBo	Well, that's at least a better workaround; tho yeh, no idea what would be affecting just Chrome and Safari (they don't even use the same render engine anymore) and nothing else

2018-07-22 14:27:15	CoJaBo	Lucas: Sometimes 3rd-party software used to install extensions (meaning, a buggy extension would land in any previously-installed browser), tho that hasn't been a thing for a while.. Could still be worth checking that Chrome and Safari don't happen to have the same extension installed tho

2018-07-22 14:31:28	CoJaBo	Could try a mac channel in the hopes it's somehow something mac specific if you care, or just ignore the problem and use Firefox ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-07-22 14:31:34	CoJaBo	Firefox Quantum is way better

2018-07-22 14:32:44	CoJaBo	Lucas: Vs. previous versions, it's got a largely rewritten/faster rendering engine and stuff
2018-07-22 14:33:00	CoJaBo	It's been out for a while now, everything since 57 IIRC
2018-07-22 14:33:58	CoJaBo	Supposedly it's at least as fast as Chrome, if not faster. And they use the same extensions API anymore so all your Chrome extenstions are probably also available on FF

2018-07-22 14:51:56	dangerouskiwi	"The power strip and extension cord should have a minimum of 12 gauge wire. This keeps the wire gauge constant, and minimizes points of high resistance." by minimum, does this mean 10 gauge is good but 14/16 are bad or the opposite?
2018-07-22 14:54:13	@Swede	10 gauge is larger. Mixing is ok, but thinner wire has more losses

2018-07-22 20:21:46	krysztal	Exactly why I try to avoid windows at all cost
2018-07-22 20:22:40	TheRevor	Hi, my laptops old hard drive needed to be replaced, so i bought a new one and replaced it. Now I am having trouble using a usb drive to install windows 10. I have a 32 gb usb drive, formatted, and has the windows 10 IRC file on it. When i inserit into my laptop and press F8 for the boot menu, it says that the system cannot find any bootable device
2018-07-22 20:22:40	TheRevor	s.
2018-07-22 20:24:21	krysztal	My point exactly
2018-07-22 20:24:35	krysztal	Do you used Windows 10 media creation tool, yes?
2018-07-22 20:25:05	TheRevor	Yes
2018-07-22 20:25:32	krysztal	Do you made it create iso file, or write directly to USB drive?

2018-07-22 20:28:04	krysztal	But you have to choose "usb flash drive"
2018-07-22 20:28:11	TheRevor	Ok thats right I used usb flash drive
2018-07-22 20:28:50	krysztal	Then you should have a bunch of files and directories on said flash drive, yes?

2018-07-22 20:31:09	Rhys	Headset won't connect through USB, only through Audio jack

2018-07-22 21:25:06	timber	I'm reaching out because I have a problem with my WIFI connection lately.
2018-07-22 21:25:31	timber	It has been two days since I can still see all available wifi connection but for some reasons, cannot connect
2018-07-22 21:25:49	@DoctorDick	You try safe mode with networking?
2018-07-22 21:25:54	timber	My computer is a Acer aspire VX 15, and the network adapter is qualcomm atheros qca61x4a
2018-07-22 21:26:12	timber	I did try to uninstall the network card, checked the drivers update
2018-07-22 21:26:24	timber	even downloaded some previous drivers, nothing
2018-07-22 21:26:54	timber	I start thinking that the card itself (hardware is damage) but then why could I still see available wifi network
2018-07-22 21:27:19	timber	Hello Doctordick, nope not sure I did.

2018-07-22 21:46:26	timber	even downloaded previous drivers from acer

2018-07-23 03:40:18	@Shadeblast	with it opened up?
2018-07-23 03:40:22	@Mikeee	you disassembled it and removed the fan from the heatsink, right?
2018-07-23 03:40:30	@Mikeee	or did you just randomly blow air into holes
2018-07-23 03:41:04	missmiddlestrom	i dont feel comfortable taking it apart more that it already is (keyboard removed and mouse finger pad removed) i just dont think i could get it back together
2018-07-23 03:41:14	@Mikeee	you likely lodged any clumps of hair and dust into bad places. You have to remove the fan from the heatsink and clean between the two to properly clean a laptop
2018-07-23 03:41:51	@Mikeee	have a neighbor kid do it, or anyone who has the very basics of computer skills
2018-07-23 03:41:53	missmiddlestrom	the fan vent has lots of air coming out though
2018-07-23 03:42:26	@Mikeee	oh i don't doubt that. You likely blew the pad of dust and hair into a different place
2018-07-23 03:42:38	@Mikeee	eventually it can get clogged in the fan and cause the fan to burn up and fail
2018-07-23 03:42:43	missmiddlestrom	to keep it running i have various chunks of metal acting as i heat sink resting on the motherboard?
2018-07-23 03:43:06	@Mikeee	just properly clean it.
2018-07-23 03:43:23	@Mikeee	and repaste the processor/gpu and whatever else is heatsinked
2018-07-23 03:43:43	@Mikeee	underclock it too, that'll help with heat

2018-07-23 13:49:33	@whitewolf	windows 10 doesn't require hardwre support for online reactivation, they store a hardware profile and will re-match it upon reactivation as long as you don't mutate the hardware much

2018-07-23 14:35:43	Bjoolzern	vg.no
2018-07-23 14:35:47	CoJaBo	Modern websites don't use HTML to load images, they use a mountain of JS and custom CDN redirections. Those tend to be very fragile
2018-07-23 14:36:52	CoJaBo	Clicked a random article, there's a bunch of large black rectangles in the middle of the article; not sure if ads, or images failing to load
2018-07-23 14:37:52	Lynn25	Did this just start occuring?
2018-07-23 14:39:07	Lynn25	I see advertisements not loading correctly.. that could be because I'm in the US. Images load fine for me
2018-07-23 14:40:59	CoJaBo	In the US and using Firefox, all the images on the homepage load fine, but most articles have large black squares where something isn't loading, including the heading image in some. Looks like something is broke on their end.
2018-07-23 14:41:25	CoJaBo	That, or it's throwing a fit over ublock

2018-07-23 15:03:15	CoJaBo	If it's slow to read especially after a clean install, yeh, the drive is probably failing
2018-07-23 15:04:15	CoJaBo	To fully fix it, you'd have to replace the drive; it just depends on how important your data is, and you should always have backups in any case
2018-07-23 15:04:17	Unix	yeah. that's what i figured. as soon as i get my big boy pc repaired i won't be using this anymore though

2018-07-23 15:34:57	Unix	Mikeee if he made it himself. that's probably a $25 cable if you buy it premade
2018-07-23 15:35:08	CoJaBo	I get ~3-4MB/sec with n on 5Ghz
2018-07-23 15:35:12	CoJaBo	Wifi sucks
2018-07-23 15:35:13	@Mandevwin	Unix, actually $6
2018-07-23 15:35:28	@Mikeee	Unix:  only if you're an idiot
2018-07-23 15:35:30	Unix	I used to work at Target, we're overpriced XD
2018-07-23 15:35:52	@Mikeee	nobody smart would ever buy electronics from a physical store
2018-07-23 15:35:52	CoJaBo	Staples sells those for >$50
2018-07-23 15:36:13	@Mandevwin	and idiots shop at staples
2018-07-23 15:36:44	Lynn25	Staples still exists?
2018-07-23 15:36:47	CoJaBo	They still sell UPSs cheaper than most places I can get them
2018-07-23 15:36:57	jacob1234	ok ill wait for the cable to ship but if the problem is the wifi and not the isp what do I do
2018-07-23 15:36:59	CoJaBo	But everything else is marked up like 5000% rofl
2018-07-23 15:37:17	@Mikeee	jacob1234: then you come back in here and we'll help you diagnose
2018-07-23 15:37:17	Unix	I guess im not a total idiot, I made my own 75ft. cat6 cable instead of buying one
2018-07-23 15:37:42	jacob1234	ok thanks everyone.

2018-07-23 15:38:24	CoJaBo	There's a company that sells directional ethernet cables for hifi audio systems, for $10,000
2018-07-23 15:38:25	Unix	they were making the comment that idiots buy from stores
2018-07-23 15:38:26	@Mikeee	your logic is flawed
2018-07-23 15:38:34	CoJaBo	Never underestimate the willingness of idiots to overpay
2018-07-23 15:39:00	Lynn25	@Mikeee agreed
2018-07-23 15:39:45	Unix	alright. well since I haven't yet dc'd, it looks like something in that startup list might have been causing an issue? looking at the list it didn't seem like it would though

2018-07-23 15:43:28	Zupp	I have some Sony Headphones, model WH-1000XM2 to be exact, and when I try ti turn them on, they would just flash the power led for a split second and then turn off. I let them charge for 4 hours and the charging led stopped accordingly. Any ideas?
2018-07-23 15:43:57	Zupp	I don't know where I could get some help about this, I'm sorry
2018-07-23 15:44:05	@Mikeee	Do they have a wired connector available
2018-07-23 15:44:11	Zupp	The Sony forum didn't help me either
2018-07-23 15:44:27	Zupp	Yes, they work flawlessly in wired connection
2018-07-23 15:44:45	CoJaBo	Could also see what happens if you turn it on while plugged into the charger
2018-07-23 15:45:12	CoJaBo	ffs, its raining again
2018-07-23 15:45:17	Unix	Could some of the Nvidia network or telemtry services have been interfering with normal network processes. bluetooth and google updater services are the only 2 other services i turned off in clean boot
2018-07-23 15:45:22	Zupp	They were made so when you plug them in, even while they're on, they turn off, tried it, and it didn't work
2018-07-23 15:46:07	Zupp	Btw, I got them as a gift so I don't have any warranty
2018-07-23 15:46:26	@Mikeee	you do have a warranty
2018-07-23 15:46:31	@Mikeee	unless you stole them

2018-07-23 15:47:17	@Mikeee	so they're defective and he stole them so he couldn't return them
2018-07-23 15:47:26	Zupp	He got them a month ago and used wired only connection because he lost the warranty
2018-07-23 15:47:44	@Mikeee	you can't lose the warranty, its tied to the serial number.
2018-07-23 15:47:50	CoJaBo	got a receipt or anything showing when it was bought?
2018-07-23 15:47:51	@Mikeee	he lied to you.
2018-07-23 15:47:59	Zupp	I was with him when he bought them, but he threw away the box with the warranty in it

2018-07-23 15:48:07	@Mikeee	or you lied to us

2018-07-23 15:48:25	@Mikeee	no idea
2018-07-23 15:48:30	Zupp	I just want them to be fixed man
2018-07-23 15:48:34	CoJaBo	That's just the card with the terms; a receipt or anything showing purchase date should be enough
2018-07-23 15:48:41	@Mikeee	then go through the warranty
2018-07-23 15:48:55	CoJaBo	In some cases, they'll honor it even without that
2018-07-23 15:49:03	Zupp	I still have the receipt, but not the warranty or the box

2018-07-23 15:50:09	CoJaBo	Sony's website should have that info, or find a number and call them

2018-07-23 15:51:38	@Mikeee	"without the warranty" is not a valid term
2018-07-23 15:51:41	CoJaBo	The warranty card just tells you what the warranty terms are
2018-07-23 15:51:47	@Mikeee	the warranty is NOT a piece of paper
2018-07-23 15:51:56	Unix	they have a copy of the warranty as long as you provide proof of purchase. ala the receipt you said you have
2018-07-23 15:52:03	@Mikeee	the warranty is a service tied to the product, it's not a physical paper.
2018-07-23 15:52:04	Zupp	Oh, I see
2018-07-23 15:52:10	Zupp	I see, I see
2018-07-23 15:52:16	@Mikeee	if its outside of warranty, they'll charge for the repair.

2018-07-23 15:52:49	CoJaBo	Zupp: The store will usually handle that as a return, which you can't do without the box; that's why the store refused, it has nothing to do with warranty there.
2018-07-23 15:52:54	Unix	Asus just replaced my $350 motherboard with no questions asked after a lightning strike
2018-07-23 15:53:02	Unix	it depends on the company
2018-07-23 15:53:15	CoJaBo	You wont have the same problem with the manufacturer, since you'll do a warranty claim not a return
2018-07-23 15:53:17	Zupp	Well, I had a mobo which was scratched on the back by my son and they replaced it no questions asked
2018-07-23 15:53:33	Zupp	It was a x399 mobo for a threadripper build
2018-07-23 15:53:42	@Mikeee	both of those situations are unethical
2018-07-23 15:53:47	@Mikeee	and you should feel like garbage
2018-07-23 15:54:21	Zupp	What? Why?
2018-07-23 15:54:25	Unix	I wasn't the one who did it, and wasnt' notified till after
2018-07-23 15:54:31	@Mikeee	If you damaged it, its not a defective product
2018-07-23 15:54:35	Unix	those aren't conditions covered under their warranty
2018-07-23 15:55:00	@Mikeee	and shouldn't be covered just because a company wants positive PR
2018-07-23 15:55:05	Zupp	Well, they did, the mobo did post but it was just scratched
2018-07-23 15:55:19	Zupp	I just wanted to be sure that it'll be fine
2018-07-23 15:55:56	@Mikeee	you're the reason other companies are so stingy on coverage - you abused the system for something YOU YOURSELF damaged
2018-07-23 15:56:14	CoJaBo	If there's accidental damage and you didn't tell them about it, they can bill you for the replacement. They won't always do so, but they can.
2018-07-23 15:56:27	CoJaBo	ASrock's support tho, is a PITA
2018-07-23 15:56:41	CoJaBo	I got a board that was missing parts, and it took 2 fricking months to get them :/
2018-07-23 15:56:51	@Mikeee	in a perfect world every company could offer no-questions-asked replacement, but sadly people are garbage and will abuse it
2018-07-23 15:57:09	@Mikeee	such as getting a replacement when a child damages the product
2018-07-23 15:57:13	Zupp	Well, I informed them, the store also took photos, it was scratched because of the screws on the case that keep the mobo in place
2018-07-23 15:57:19	CoJaBo	I bought it incomplete at a deep discount, so it wasn't a warranty issue; but still, that's an insane turn-around time.

I recently just completely wiped my computer to get a fresh start. cloned my windows 10 os onto my ssd and went into the bios to make it the #1 boot drive but got a "please insert a proper boot drive" error when I did.
2018-07-23 20:07:23	@PipeItToDevNull	ledzepp42, install properly to it, without the HDD being in the machine 
2018-07-23 20:07:45	@PipeItToDevNull	You could not have "completely wiped" and "cloned" at the same time 
2018-07-23 20:07:51	BenEmm	Looking it up now @DoctorDick, thanks
2018-07-23 20:08:15	ledzepp42	well completely wiped meaning did the standard recovery to factory is what I should've said
2018-07-23 20:08:24	@PipeItToDevNull	Ok, so that is nothing

2018-07-23 21:03:09	Stend	Hello. My windows defender ransomware protection keeps giving notifications that svchost was blocked from making changes to folder %userprofile%\videos, this never used to happen. also my svchost.exe file is only 50.0 KB in size, which seems odd.
2018-07-23 21:03:33	@Mikeee	copy it and run it through virustotal
2018-07-23 21:03:37	Stend	I also have a file called svchost.exe.mui i've never heard of in system32

2018-07-23 21:09:02	Stend	I didn't enable it myself, but it seems to be through windows defender and now that it's blocking all this random stuff I don't want to disable it

2018-07-23 21:10:23	@PipeItToDevNull	It isnt blocking 'ransomware', it is blocking programs from accessing files that defender thinks it should not be
2018-07-23 21:10:24	@Mikeee	clean install it, then restore all your important files from backup
2018-07-23 21:10:37	@PipeItToDevNull	should not be accessing*

2018-07-24 00:02:41	youknow12345	toxic is used as a short way to describe the way you interpret rules. Make them vauge then ban people for not understanding it. To be clear banning someone for offering to help is toxic. It's like smacking the guy in the face trying to pick you up after you fall. It's toxic behavior.

I recently got a HP Compaq 6000 with a Pentium at 3.06 ghz. it originally came with one stick of ram at 2 gigs, but whenever i try to add more it beeps 5 times, signaling a ram/mobo problem. There is one white slot, and three black slots. Whenever the one working stick is placed in a slot other than the white slot, the bios warns me about an in

Similar things have happened with reddit.  Netflix and Youtube work fine.  Is something wrong with the service or is my ISP throttling?

2018-07-25 16:28:12	Halosos	Files downloaded via google drive constantly trying to sync and have a blue person icon in front of it. I have tried moving, copy and pasting, zipping and extracting, rebooting and closing google drive.    Because the files are 'shared', it is preventing them from being accessed by certain applications
2018-07-25 16:30:40	@PipeItToDevNull	What programs cannot access the files 
2018-07-25 16:31:40	Halosos	The files in question are the files for a server, and the server cannot run.  I should have worded the original issue better, sorry.
2018-07-25 16:32:21	@PipeItToDevNull	What server 
2018-07-25 16:33:11	Halosos	A modded minecraft server, which I know for a fact worked before it was transferred to me VIA google drive.
2018-07-25 16:34:47	@PipeItToDevNull	Was it zipped 
2018-07-25 16:35:20	Halosos	It was not sent zipped. The person who origonally sent it is now out of contact and won't be able to resend the server in a .zip format
2018-07-25 16:35:52	@PipeItToDevNull	What are the errors in the server 
2018-07-25 16:36:18	Halosos	"the state engine was in incorrect state errored and forced into state available"
2018-07-25 16:36:28	@PipeItToDevNull	is the jar modded 
2018-07-25 16:36:51	@PipeItToDevNull	aside from being FTB
2018-07-25 16:37:03	Halosos	It is a heavily modded server. It was a pre-built modpack with 6 additional mods

2018-07-25 16:47:43	Halosos	I am unsure what mod that is connected to, however, I will just mention, the server did work before it was sent to me. The only change is the fact that the files are now listed as shared
2018-07-25 16:47:59	shteve13	Hi, I just finished building my computer and am trying to install windows 10 but it will not recognize my Crucial MX500 M.2 Sata SSD. Using a AS Rock AB350M Pro 4 motherboard and ryzen 5 2400g cpu.

2018-07-25 19:34:54	@PipeItToDevNull	The delete key 
2018-07-25 19:34:59	@PipeItToDevNull	Or right click 
2018-07-25 19:35:06	ehelofa	no its too big
2018-07-25 19:35:12	@deww	or shift-delete (doesn't go through recycle bin)
2018-07-25 19:35:24	@deww	does windows actually say it's too much?
2018-07-25 19:35:45	ehelofa	no it jusy takes long time

2018-07-25 19:40:40	endmymissouri	my gtx 750 ti has a passive heat sink and two fans on top of that, but it doesn't fit in my pc with the fan. If i remove the fan and leave the passive heat sink, then it fits. Is it safe to do that ?
2018-07-25 19:41:16	@Mikeee	so its active cooling
2018-07-25 19:41:19	CoJaBo	..it's not a passive if it has fans lol
2018-07-25 19:41:43	@Mikeee	and no, you need to keep the fans, they exist for a reason
2018-07-25 19:42:00	@Mikeee	you can install different fans, just ensure the air flow is the same or greater than the original
2018-07-25 19:42:40	CoJaBo	I tried running my GeForce 8400 GS without the tiny, noisy, barely-blowing-at-all fan, and even with the case fan blowing right on it, it still gets hot almost immediately
2018-07-25 19:42:58	@Mikeee	because the heatsinks are tiny.
2018-07-25 19:43:05	@Mikeee	they're not designed for passive cooling
2018-07-25 19:43:12	CoJaBo	Also, the driver wasn't loading
2018-07-25 19:43:16	CoJaBo	Which didn't help
2018-07-25 19:43:21	@Mikeee	hopefully you didn't do damage to it
2018-07-25 19:43:31	endmymissouri	oh : (
2018-07-25 19:44:14	endmymissouri	i do have a fan inside the pc, does that make any difference ?
2018-07-25 19:44:18	@Mikeee	no.
2018-07-25 19:44:29	@Mikeee	case fans do little to nothing to cool individual components.
2018-07-25 19:44:37	CoJaBo	endmymissouri: Mine was blowing right on mine and I can confirm it did exactly squat
2018-07-25 19:44:47	endmymissouri	ouch ok
2018-07-25 19:44:57	endmymissouri	so its probably best for me to return it and get a smaller one lol
2018-07-25 19:45:08	CoJaBo	That'd be easiest if you can't change the case
2018-07-25 19:45:21	endmymissouri	yea thats not an option for me rn
2018-07-25 19:45:21	@Mikeee	yes unless you want to invest into more complex cooling
2018-07-25 19:46:13	@Mikeee	its always an option, since you can get a shitty desktop from the thrift store for a couple of bucks that will work
2018-07-25 19:46:22	@Mikeee	but it'll just be ugly
2018-07-25 19:46:42	endmymissouri	hmm i think ill just find another gtx
2018-07-25 19:46:49	CoJaBo	I almost never pay for cases
2018-07-25 19:47:01	endmymissouri	it sucks cuz the pci e slot is about 1 cm off
2018-07-25 19:47:30	@Mikeee	CoJaBo:  same. unless you're a 15 year old, fancy looking cases are meaningless
2018-07-25 19:47:36	CoJaBo	Ancient POS Dell Dimension case that's got razor-sharp edges? Good enough =D

2018-07-25 19:48:44	endmymissouri	yea mines a hp compaq desktp
2018-07-25 19:48:46	@Mikeee	i just ripped out all the failed electronics and built into it
2018-07-25 19:48:53	CoJaBo	My old server case: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e8/72/98/e87298aa35e0e6009b1759250840c711.jpg
2018-07-25 19:49:07	CoJaBo	Not a single one of the fans lasted more than a year
2018-07-25 19:49:10	endmymissouri	that looks pretty cool
2018-07-25 19:49:22	robocop	hey guys
2018-07-25 19:49:25	robocop	there is a file that wont delete
2018-07-25 19:49:29	robocop	how can i delete it
2018-07-25 19:49:37	CoJaBo	Cheapest thing I could get ahold of, even included a moderately-sketchy PSU :P
2018-07-25 19:49:41	robocop	says could not find this item
2018-07-25 19:49:41	@Mikeee	the purpose of a case is to assist in cooling and protecting the components
2018-07-25 19:50:33	CoJaBo	It also doubled as main lighting for the room before all the LED fans died
2018-07-25 19:50:35	@Mikeee	the bigger the case, the worse the cooling. the more lights and fancy shit on it, the less money was put into construction. giant fans aren't good, they're just there to compensate for horrible design
2018-07-25 19:50:51	CoJaBo	robocop: shift+delete doesn't work?
2018-07-25 19:50:56	robocop	no
2018-07-25 19:51:16	robocop	file name is Ssegmono_boot
2018-07-25 19:51:18	robocop	segmono_boot
2018-07-25 19:51:30	endmymissouri	wait i have an idea
2018-07-25 19:51:35	CoJaBo	Probably in use or something dumb; close what's using it, or reboot
2018-07-25 19:51:48	robocop	i already reboooted
2018-07-25 19:51:49	endmymissouri	what if i keep the fan, but tilt it in an angle so that it stills work but doesnt get in the way
2018-07-25 19:51:57	robocop	its from my external hardrive
2018-07-25 19:52:02	@Mikeee	endmymissouri:  no.
2018-07-25 19:52:10	@Mikeee	It has to be flush with the heatsink
2018-07-25 19:52:29	@Mikeee	can't have air escaping without flowing through the pins
2018-07-25 19:52:33	CoJaBo	I replaced all the case fans with hideous ones ripped from OEM Pentium 4 systems I have giant stacks of. It looks quite hilarious with all the clear sides showcasing them
2018-07-25 19:52:36	@Mikeee	the fins*
2018-07-25 19:52:55	@Mikeee	and the fins help turn pressure into volume, as the air travels in a single direction along them
2018-07-25 19:53:09	CoJaBo	Tell that to Linus =D
2018-07-25 19:53:47	CoJaBo	There's an LTT vid where he cuts down one of those giant heatsink cards to fit in a single-width, using a massive fan and ducting
2018-07-25 19:53:55	@Mikeee	endmymissouri: you can get a pressure-oriented fan, such as a centrifugal blower, and duct the air from it to the fans, assuming there's space
2018-07-25 19:54:50	CoJaBo	(Spoiler alert: It overheats)
2018-07-25 19:54:51	CoJaBo	endmymissouri: If you want to stick with the same card, there's often variants with lower-profile cooling; tho they tend to be more expensive, ofc
2018-07-25 19:54:54	robocop	what shoul i do
2018-07-25 19:55:18	@Mikeee	robocop: is the rest of the drive empty?
2018-07-25 19:55:21	robocop	no
2018-07-25 19:55:25	CoJaBo	robocop: Scandisk/chkdisk or whatever it's called, maybe there's coruption or something
2018-07-25 19:55:27	robocop	i have important files
2018-07-25 19:55:45	@Mikeee	well i'd say format the drive and restore those files from the backups you surely made because you're not insane
2018-07-25 19:56:01	robocop	its brand new drive
2018-07-25 19:56:02	robocop	lol
2018-07-25 19:56:15	@Mikeee	and?
2018-07-25 19:56:43	robocop	how do i delete it
2018-07-25 19:56:45	robocop	:(
2018-07-25 19:56:51	CoJaBo	robocop: did you try scandisk?
2018-07-25 19:56:54	@Mikeee	why not format the drive and restore from backup?
2018-07-25 19:57:32	robocop	scandisk?
2018-07-25 19:57:45	robocop	how?
2018-07-25 19:57:56	robocop	i can save the files on my computer then format it?
2018-07-25 19:58:23	@Mikeee	what do you mean save files
2018-07-25 19:58:31	@Mikeee	you should already have multiple copies of the files
2018-07-25 19:58:41	robocop	where
2018-07-25 19:58:44	@Mikeee	there's only two options: 1. You don't have important files. 2. You have important files, but they're securely backed up in multiple locations.
2018-07-25 19:58:54	@Mikeee	any other option is invalid.
2018-07-25 19:58:58	robocop	i have important files
2018-07-25 19:59:06	robocop	so just format it and add files to it again
2018-07-25 19:59:14	CoJaBo	There's aways 3) You have important files, and you'll lose them when you drop the disk and/or it randomly fails
2018-07-25 19:59:23	CoJaBo	:P
2018-07-25 19:59:26	@Mikeee	if you have important files and they're not backed up in multiple places, your #1 concern at the moment is getting them backed up
2018-07-25 19:59:40	@Mikeee	after you have them backed up, THEN you can focus on other stuff
2018-07-25 20:00:18	robocop	ok
2018-07-25 20:00:23	robocop	what do you have
2018-07-25 20:00:27	robocop	Where did you save them

2018-07-25 20:00:37	CoJaBo	..anywhere else lol

2018-07-25 20:01:08	@PipeItToDevNull	And infinite storage =P
2018-07-25 20:01:21	@Mikeee	for things under 10gb, just use a cloud storage solution
2018-07-25 20:02:09	@Mikeee	10gb to 1tb, use other computers. Backup yours to your parents pc and vice versa, or a friend or a work system
2018-07-25 20:02:18	@Mikeee	anything above 1tb you can just buy a drive
2018-07-25 20:02:25	@Mikeee	storage is like $20/tb now
2018-07-25 20:02:28	CoJaBo	10GB is a small SDcard these days; I prefer that even over The Clown
2018-07-25 20:02:29	@Mikeee	even less on sales
2018-07-25 20:02:44	@Mikeee	sd cards are not valid for long term storage
2018-07-25 20:02:49	@Mikeee	neither is flash memory
2018-07-25 20:03:21	CoJaBo	I don't trust The Clown for long-term either, fwiw.
2018-07-25 20:03:46	CoJaBo	It's there, until it isn't.
2018-07-25 20:04:16	@Mikeee	robocop: if you don't backup your data securely to multiple locations, you will lose it. It's not a matter of "if" it's a matter of when.
2018-07-25 20:04:18	CoJaBo	(and yet, I work for a co that provides Clown Storage as a product <_<)
2018-07-25 20:05:07	CoJaBo	..ugh, I'm wondering how many calls I'm going to get once this rain stops
2018-07-25 20:05:23	CoJaBo	"OMG my computer and all my backups were in my basement that flooded!!1"
2018-07-25 20:05:40	CoJaBo	Off-site backups, people..

2018-07-25 20:09:46	robocop	only 1 gig
2018-07-25 20:09:48	robocop	100
2018-07-25 20:11:20	CoJaBo	If everything is full, you'll want to get a second drive as an actual backup
2018-07-25 20:11:48	robocop	like 6 TB?
2018-07-25 20:11:55	robocop	or 1 TB

2018-07-25 20:17:27	CoJaBo	I never know what "memory" refers too; half the time, it's that the desktop has run out of space and icons don't fit on screen wtf
2018-07-25 20:17:40	@Mikeee	if your drive totals 100gb, you probably don't have much you actually care about on it. I'd suggest just backing it all up to google drive

2018-07-26 02:47:27	hatrick	That's weird, just reboot your router and modem, no idea why that would happen.

2018-07-26 02:48:17	borisyeltsin	login didn't work on wifi before either
2018-07-26 02:48:51	hatrick	Doesn't matter, both devices on the same network have the same experience. When removed from network it works. You can find the specific problem but it'll be faster to just reboot all the things and see if the issue still exists.
2018-07-26 02:49:25	hatrick	That includes the computer, router, modem, and wireless ap if seperate from router.
2018-07-26 02:49:42	borisyeltsin	another thing: I had been away for about 4 days with the router shut down.  problem was present before shutting down, and now after reboot.  is it still necessary to reboot?
2018-07-26 02:51:37	hatrick	computer off, then router/ap off, then modem off, then wait 30 seconds with all modem lights off, then plug in modem, then wait until all the lights are on and plug in router, wait until all lights then plug in computer. AFAIK the time set on your home network devices shouldn't matter or be a cause so no relation to leaving them unplugged.
2018-07-26 02:51:59	hatrick	*home network infrastructure
2018-07-26 02:53:58	borisyeltsin	I just meant that I had the problems a few days ago, unplugged the modem while I was out of town, and restarted it last night out of habit and the problem persists.  so it was kind of like a reboot by chance.  didn't know if still possible to fix the issue with a new reboot
2018-07-26 02:55:11	FrozenZio	Just as a side note: I have another problem. My ethernet cable along with my computer are fairly new, about half a year old, and just a month ago my ethernet connection stopped working after internet got cut off. The network for the ethernet cable remains unidentified, and I'm wondering if I'm going to have to replace the cable.

2018-07-26 04:54:50	MrSatirical	Hi. I put together my pc tonight and installed Windows 10 to the SSD. I noticed it didn't detect my HDD so I took the side off and just made sure the SATA connections were snug. When I finished, I plugged it all back up - everything booted up fine and my keyboard/mouse lit up but my monitor received no video signal.

After setting everything up I realized a decrease in download speeds by 10mb (39 to 29ish). Will this be a problem for gaming or should I revert backto wifi?

2018-07-26 19:07:47	@PipeItToDevNull	Regardless, I am not troubleshooting that OS, do a clean and legal install then see if the issue persists 
2018-07-26 19:08:22	@PipeItToDevNull	Also, never use IOBIT shitware 
2018-07-26 19:08:30	@PipeItToDevNull	NO driver finders are legit, they are all malware

2018-07-26 19:08:52	CNetworkGeek	I would add registry cleaners also, they are junk
2018-07-26 19:08:57	Goober	I've learned the hard way there.    Installed a lot of the wrong drivers on my system, too.
2018-07-26 19:09:18	CNetworkGeek	A bad driver can really hose things
2018-07-26 19:09:28	Goober	I'm confused why my GPU says it's only a 4GB vRAM system, though.
2018-07-26 19:09:34	Goober	It said it was an 8GB.
2018-07-26 19:10:13	CNetworkGeek	Hmmm, Speccy isn't perfect it can make mistakes.  But its rare that happens.
2018-07-26 19:10:14	@PipeItToDevNull	it can be wrong 
2018-07-26 19:11:01	Goober	I had no idea the driver program was so risky.   That'll be in the dumpster in no time.
2018-07-26 19:11:13	@PipeItToDevNull	That isnt the issue 
2018-07-26 19:11:18	@PipeItToDevNull	The hacker is the crack you intalled

2018-07-26 19:14:18	CNetworkGeek	Clean install at this point
2018-07-26 19:15:06	Goober	My use of that crack probably doesn't shed the best light on me, but is it possible that's contributed to a GPU problem?
2018-07-26 19:15:25	@PipeItToDevNull	Doubt it, but nothing on the OS is worth troubleshooting on 
2018-07-26 19:15:44	CNetworkGeek	Its possible no doubt.  You can issues on cracked installs, but the malware bundled is usually the cause.
2018-07-26 19:15:50	CNetworkGeek	can have*
2018-07-26 19:16:36	Goober	It's just strange to me that the GPU almost seems to pick and choose when to crash.   I'm no expert, but I worked at a tech repair shop for a handful of years.   Haven't seen that.
2018-07-26 19:17:06	Goober	As in, videos = bad.   Games = fine.
2018-07-26 19:18:29	CNetworkGeek	Might wanna check your event viewer logs
2018-07-26 19:18:37	CNetworkGeek	That could shed some light
2018-07-26 19:21:44	Goober	I'll take a gander.   I appreciate your guys' time.

2018-07-26 19:41:42	twerqwe	Im not sure about that, I think that might be handled by windows10, I installed windows first and it made a partition for EFI I think

2018-07-26 19:47:02	CNetworkGeek	Okay
2018-07-26 19:47:22	CNetworkGeek	What partitions are listed for your disk?
2018-07-26 19:47:28	twerqwe	the problem resides in the new /boot partition making the first one not work, Im pretty sure
2018-07-26 19:47:40	CNetworkGeek	That's my guess also
2018-07-26 19:47:59	CNetworkGeek	GPT or MBR also, most people these days use GPT.

2018-07-26 19:48:40	@PipeItToDevNull	efibootmgr -n 0000 I think
2018-07-26 19:48:47	@PipeItToDevNull	Of, there are two ditros?
2018-07-26 19:48:52	@PipeItToDevNull	You need to use the same ESP 
2018-07-26 19:49:03	@PipeItToDevNull	Make the partitions and declare it

2018-07-26 19:53:59	twerqwe	sda5 is the first crypt partition with linux mint on the inside, then sda6 is the /boot partition I used when installing mint, then sda7 is the /boot partition I used when installing lubuntu, and sda8 is a crypt partition with lubuntu inside
2018-07-26 19:55:17	twerqwe	so as far as I understand sda6 stopped getting recognised as /boot and now nothing links to mint so I cant boot it
2018-07-26 19:55:31	@PipeItToDevNull	manually set the partitions 
2018-07-26 19:55:41	twerqwe	can u point me to some docs on how to do it
2018-07-26 19:56:25	@PipeItToDevNull	You understand encryptions, and triple booting, but now how partitions are used in Linux?

2018-07-26 19:57:25	twerqwe	so I skip stuff that might be basic to others
2018-07-26 19:57:36	@PipeItToDevNull	Choose manual during the installer, set the ESP as that partition, and the other partitions as well. It is all dependent on the installer used
2018-07-26 19:57:48	@PipeItToDevNull	They will all have a manual button 
2018-07-26 19:58:47	CNetworkGeek	Curious, are you using linux to learn/experiment, or are they your primary OS?

2018-07-26 20:00:38	twerqwe	format as /boot*
2018-07-26 20:00:42	twerqwe	excuse my english
2018-07-26 20:00:55	@PipeItToDevNull	as the ESP 
2018-07-26 20:01:08	@PipeItToDevNull	that holds directories that have files pointing to an OS 
2018-07-26 20:02:44	twerqwe	so just to make sure, I dont need to have 1 partition being ESP, and then 1 partition being /boot? just both in one? and windows will still boot along with the linux distros
2018-07-26 20:03:07	@PipeItToDevNull	boot is not the ESP 
2018-07-26 20:03:33	CNetworkGeek	Windows will only need ESP to boot, so it should be fine
2018-07-26 20:03:50	@PipeItToDevNull	it is mounted at /boot/efi 
2018-07-26 20:03:56	@PipeItToDevNull	I do not use seperate boot partitions 
2018-07-26 20:04:11	@PipeItToDevNull	I mount an encrypted /home 
2018-07-26 20:04:20	@PipeItToDevNull	Because that is where the data is that needs to be protected 
2018-07-26 20:04:32	twerqwe	I normally dont either, but the installer asked me to make one since the OS was inside of a encrypted partition
2018-07-26 20:04:52	@PipeItToDevNull	I separate an OS from the data 
2018-07-26 20:05:00	@PipeItToDevNull	I can nuke my entire OS, and lose nothing

2018-07-26 20:07:11	@PipeItToDevNull	How?

2018-07-26 20:17:49	twerqwe	It's far too easy for data to accidentally leak outside of /home. You thought of /tmp; there is also /var/tmp. And, depending on the programs you use, each has its own spot in /var — e.g., you put some data in MySQL, and oops that was /var/lib/mysql. Did you also remember mail in /var/mail and /var/spool/exim? or the print spool in /var/spool/cups (if you use CUPS; elsewhere with other print systems)? Or /var/log can easily

2018-07-26 20:23:17	Cronosnake	I probably should have prefaced it in saying that my computer has had bouts of crashing, usually in game though. Like, suddenly volume would slow down to a halt, screen would freeze, computer was unresponsive (was kicked from voice channels when this happened) but I had to do a hard shutdown before turning it back on

2018-07-27 00:55:22	Seafu	I don't see any red

2018-07-27 00:57:20	putuguk	My pc is not able to use the DP for my monitor, when I select input to displayport it freezes up and gives me a D4 error (pci allocation resources erroe)
2018-07-27 00:57:31	@Shadeblast	Hmm, I'd go with disk or memory then which are sort of easily checked

2018-07-27 01:03:40	Seafu	when you say run for "a while" how long is that?
2018-07-27 01:03:47	@Shadeblast	putuguk: yeah I'll be honest I've only seen that happen in new systems 
2018-07-27 01:03:56	@Shadeblast	Seafu: advised is overnight (8 hrs)
2018-07-27 01:04:18	Seafu	oof
2018-07-27 01:04:18	putuguk	could it possibly be a problem with my RAM?
2018-07-27 01:04:39	putuguk	or my GPU?
2018-07-27 01:06:22	@Shadeblast	Are the issues consistent?
2018-07-27 01:06:29	@Shadeblast	Like does it still boot sometimes?
2018-07-27 01:07:41	putuguk	it boots no prbolem, just my display freezes up when I switch between hdmi and DP

I only know she died bc of facebook of course, i dont actually know the chick. But she does say she kept if for valuable resource to others. Bummer. I hope I can find all the pages

2018-07-27 12:06:37	Helperino	My issue is that my computer for no spesific reason, at random short intervals, just decides to turn off completly (as if i were to pull the power outlet out ) and then turn the pc back on
2018-07-27 12:07:20	LSKennedy	that sounds like a failing PSU
2018-07-27 12:07:25	Helperino	And then turn back on, dont mind "the pc" part
2018-07-27 12:08:03	Helperino	What makes you think that its not anything else?
2018-07-27 12:08:59	LSKennedy	What happens before this? Is there any kind of common factor?
2018-07-27 12:09:10	LSKennedy	Heavy load? only when gaming?

2018-07-27 12:11:11	No	Why did i name myself no everytime someone says no longer it looks like they tagged me
2018-07-27 12:11:22	No	BUt what happend with my problem ?
2018-07-27 12:11:36	Helperino	Not really, i could open the browser and the shut down would occur, i could be playing a game and it would happen, even when it just sitting doing nothing
2018-07-27 12:11:52	LSKennedy	Then I'd say that takes faulty ram out of the equation
2018-07-27 12:11:58	LSKennedy	which still points me towards a bad PSU
2018-07-27 12:12:03	MikeFromIT	No try making a file in C:\temp
2018-07-27 12:13:24	Helperino	Could it be the motherboard or the cpu?
2018-07-27 12:13:33	Helperino	Ill look for a psu
2018-07-27 12:14:30	LSKennedy	in my experience, the cpu doesn't often cause this, you'd get a BSOD or something, not just hard resets like that

2018-07-27 14:30:23	@PipeItToDevNull	But that will fuck up the p2v

2018-07-27 16:26:28	CoJaBo	and the connection between the other one and the router or whatnot is also good?
2018-07-27 16:27:24	CrazySlick	yea that connection is good as well
2018-07-27 16:27:43	CrazySlick	the ethernet light is blinking which means its transferring data according to the manual
2018-07-27 16:27:49	CrazySlick	idk if thats good
2018-07-27 16:30:41	CoJaBo	CrazySlick: Only thing I can think to test next would be to connect the computer directly to the router, to see if it's an issue with the powerline thing or elsewhere
2018-07-27 16:31:09	CoJaBo	CrazySlick: Are you able to get to the router's config page? I wouldn't expect so, but try..
2018-07-27 16:32:19	CrazySlick	Would i do that on my laptop that has wifi or the desktop that cant connect
2018-07-27 16:33:14	CoJaBo	The one that can't connect. You can also connect the laptop to the powerline adaptor (after turning off the wifi) to test if that can connect thru it, might be easier than moving the desktop
2018-07-27 16:36:22	CrazySlick	Don't think I can access the routers config page
2018-07-27 16:36:37	CrazySlick	Is there anything else we can try before I have to move my desktop? My laptop doesn't have an ethernet port
2018-07-27 16:37:14	CrazySlick	When I check ipconfig /all the ipv4 address is 169.254.112.180

2018-07-27 17:02:15	pasi123567	My Desktop has like 260gb more than my SSD has space
2018-07-27 17:07:58	CoJaBo	pasi123567: Easiest way is likely just going to be to add the SSD as a second drive and do a new clean install on it. You can leave the files on the old one and use them from there, and also delete the old Windows install eventually to save space on the old HDD
2018-07-27 17:09:13	CoJaBo	Preserving the install is possible, but will take a lot more effort and probably require another spare disk as scratch space; I'd imagine it'll be much faster to just do a clean install in nearly any case
2018-07-27 17:10:22	mactruk	hello, I dropped my 17" MBP mid 2010, it was a short drop, but now the screen flickers with a almost perfect horizontal spit (not cracked) down the middle and eventually blacks out. Any ideas what broke? I have a gif link to see, if needed.
2018-07-27 17:11:23	MikeFromIT	It might not be cracked but your display is still probably messed up
2018-07-27 17:12:38	mactruk	so replace display? not a graphics card jarred loose or something?
2018-07-27 17:13:09	MikeFromIT	Connect it to an external display and see if it happens. My money would still overall be on the display being broke
2018-07-27 17:13:10	CoJaBo	mactruk: You can post the gif, but most likely you cracked the edge of the display, interfering with some of the circuit traces/connections
2018-07-27 17:13:28	CoJaBo	That won't necessarily be visible
2018-07-27 17:13:31	pasi123567	Well I would have a spare disk though. Because I already upgraded from 1tb to 3tb like half a year ago.

2018-07-27 17:14:42	pasi123567	rip well then I need to do the exact same as I did with the 1 to 3tb upgrade right?
2018-07-27 17:14:57	@DoctorDick	pasi123567, The best practice is to reinstall Windows onto the SSD
2018-07-27 17:15:02	@DoctorDick	And use the HDD as data storage
2018-07-27 17:15:15	MikeFromIT	mactruk still pretty sure it is the display
2018-07-27 17:15:22	pasi123567	I would use the HDD for everythign except games and adobe programs
2018-07-27 17:17:27	mactruk	ok thanks, yeah it's not making any nosies and I popped the back off nothing appears damaged. Will search for a new display for this relic.
2018-07-27 17:17:48	CoJaBo	Or just use an external one :P
2018-07-27 17:18:07	CoJaBo	I have a bunch of laptops with busted screens and/or keyboards that are just used as desktops <_<
2018-07-27 17:19:05	pasi123567	Oh also another problem I just remembered with this post. Is my screen damaged badly? Like will it get worse I mean. There is like a faint brighter line on top of the display
2018-07-27 17:20:09	CoJaBo	pasi123567: Is it a single pixel or more like a gradient?

2018-07-27 18:23:38	CNetworkGeek	kk
2018-07-27 18:24:21	@DoctorDick	madusa77, What version of BIOS do you have?
2018-07-27 18:25:11	madusa77	it should be the latest as I thought but since I can't see it to get into it I can't tell anymore
2018-07-27 18:25:37	@DoctorDick	Well it needs to be at least 3803
2018-07-27 18:25:48	CNetworkGeek	What CPU?
2018-07-27 18:26:05	madusa77	exactly why I'm thinking it might be the bios
2018-07-27 18:27:22	CNetworkGeek	You still have the old CPU?
2018-07-27 18:29:28	madusa77	no sadly that one died to the point where I couldn't even power up
2018-07-27 18:30:41	CNetworkGeek	ah I see
2018-07-27 18:31:06	CNetworkGeek	Do it overheat, or was it just older?
2018-07-27 18:31:10	CNetworkGeek	Did it*
2018-07-27 18:31:53	madusa77	Older
2018-07-27 18:32:51	CNetworkGeek	gotcha
2018-07-27 18:33:05	CNetworkGeek	What's your new CPU?
2018-07-27 18:33:15	madusa77	ryzen 5 2600

2018-07-27 18:59:55	madusa77	but I believe I do need a bootkit just emailed amd

2018-07-27 19:00:56	CNetworkGeek	That may be your problem
2018-07-27 19:01:09	markasoftware	erik324: maybe check game integrity through Steam, and make sure you aren't running out of RAM
2018-07-27 19:01:39	erik324	Nah, Markas, I have tried that. I even reformatted my hard drives to fix a different issue and this one persists
2018-07-27 19:01:51	erik324	& have 16gb of ram
2018-07-27 19:01:54	markasoftware	did you check that it's not eating all your ram?
2018-07-27 19:02:27	markasoftware	i had a similar issues with Deus Ex recently and it ended up being that it was eating all 8gb of my ram
2018-07-27 19:02:38	markasoftware	but yeah, doom *should* run ok with 16gb
2018-07-27 19:03:01	erik324	I will check that! It's weird because it used to run fine. Then one day I reinstalled it and on this one specific loading screen it crashes
2018-07-27 19:03:04	@Swede	meh. lower game rez a lot, get past that level
2018-07-27 19:03:09	CNetworkGeek	@madusa77, you see that link?
2018-07-27 19:03:12	madusa77	Yea
2018-07-27 19:03:20	CNetworkGeek	What was your BIOS version?
2018-07-27 19:03:40	madusa77	I thought it was the latest version but I could be wrong
2018-07-27 19:04:19	tomeaton17	Does it crash when you run a gpu stress test
2018-07-27 19:04:25	madusa77	but Amd is offering loaner bootkits to 2nd gen chips owners apparently this is a new thing
2018-07-27 19:04:39	CNetworkGeek	I wasn't aware of that, but I use Intel, so that could be why
2018-07-27 19:05:11	madusa77	Don't go with a ryzen board I fucking hate these chips
2018-07-27 19:05:14	erik324	@swede no it's on the loading screen
2018-07-27 19:05:16	markasoftware	erik324: but yes, you may want to try some stress tests (i like the occt one)
2018-07-27 19:05:36	erik324	@markasoftware I have tried stress tests :/ my PC performs fine
2018-07-27 19:07:07	markasoftware	welp. Check that you aren't running low on RAM (keep task manager opuen while on the loading screen, watch the ram usage percentag), then just file a bug.
2018-07-27 19:07:17	markasoftware	but game devs don't fix bugs like this 2 years after launch :)
2018-07-27 19:08:45	madusa77	Just look at Mass Effect Andromeda
2018-07-27 19:08:58	erik324	i'd rather not look at mass effect andormeda thanks
2018-07-27 19:09:02	CNetworkGeek	@madusa77 if you had another CPU, you could confirm if the new one is the problem
2018-07-27 19:09:11	madusa77	exactly
2018-07-27 19:10:05	CNetworkGeek	I'm guessing so far, the BIOS needs an update to be used with the new CPU
2018-07-27 19:10:12	CNetworkGeek	Just from the info we have so far
2018-07-27 19:11:02	madusa77	its the only thing I can think of everything else I had another one of
2018-07-27 19:11:43	CNetworkGeek	Hmmm, just for the heck of it.  Tried a hard reset?

2018-07-28 02:14:03	fishguts	Hi all. Struggling with an issue with Windows lockups (have been for months). The PC intermittently stops responding (mouse can be moved and items on the desktop can be selected, i.e. some UI elements response, but no new windows can be opened and already opened programs become nonfunctional).
2018-07-28 02:16:21	fishguts	Happens more often when streaming a file to a client via Plex. Temperatures are normal. Sometimes happens under light use. Requires a hard reset. Have replaced the motherboard and RAM and removed the GPU. So it could be the disk (there is a system SSD and a storage HDD) or the CPU or a bad hardware driver. How can I narrow down the issue further? Xperf doesn't catch it as the event is not recorded (the lockup prevents
2018-07-28 02:16:21	fishguts	disk writes it seems). Thanks.

The headset is connected to the mic input and to the audio output thru a double switch from a 3,5mm jack.

2018-07-28 15:06:49	Aelius51	Hey, occasionally (not always) all processes will have difficulty smoothly rendering simple graphics like smooth scrolling. It's similar to what happens when you disable hardware acceleration - really choppy. Even just dragging the windows around the desktop. I'm happy to troubleshoot on my own, but I'm wondering, a) what the likely problem is (e.g. memory usage? GPU usage? CPU usage?) and b) what the likely culprit of that problem 
2018-07-28 15:06:49	Aelius51	would be. Any speculation? Windows 7 desktop, with SLI GTX 780, 16GB RAM. Updating display drivers didn't solve it. Closing background programs didn't help.

2018-07-28 17:11:45	@Virtual-Potato	those are all private IP network configuration. It reveals nothing about your public IP addresses
2018-07-28 17:12:04	Aelius51	Keyword being private, no?
2018-07-28 17:12:12	@Virtual-Potato	Private meaning local to your network
2018-07-28 17:12:51	@Virtual-Potato	If I were to make a guess, I'm going to say that your private IP address starts with 192.168.x.x

2018-07-28 17:13:58	Aelius51	Well, if someone doesn't understand which network information is compromising and which isn't, they can't be expected to know in advance that it's okay if someone sees it. :P

2018-07-28 17:16:40	Aelius51	And continuing to mention that fact does me a great disservice.

2018-07-28 17:23:42	@Virtual-Potato	My whole point is that publishing a speccy snapshot doesn't really reveal anything compromising, but going about it your own way by not using one of the key features of speccy that makes it okay to publish info about your system to the internet just hurts you

2018-07-28 20:33:56	Shadowex3	So i've got a weird one. Gaming laptop (i7-6700K/1070) hard-crashes during gaming. First it freezes up to a few seconds with audio spazzing, then it flashes a very colorful LSD trip screen, then hardboots. No dumps made. The fun: Not reproducible even when near 100C and running prime95 and unigine/furmark. ONLY crashes during gaming.

2018-07-28 22:29:35	mituna	pcpartpicker
2018-07-28 22:29:47	Appledawgs	ive only found one definitive site that said these motherboards are compatible
2018-07-28 22:29:54	mituna	it will check compatibility for you, just select the cpu you'd like and your case and it will filter
2018-07-28 22:30:17	Appledawgs	it says: Warning: These parts have potential issues/incompatibilities.
2018-07-28 22:30:37	mituna	there should be a warning details pane at the bottom
2018-07-28 22:30:40	Appledawgs	but some b350m mobos are able to be used with ryzen 2nd gen, but some aren't
2018-07-28 22:30:51	Appledawgs	Some AMD B350 chipset motherboards may need a BIOS update prior to using Raven Ridge CPUs. Upgrading the BIOS may require a different CPU that is supported by older BIOS revisions.
2018-07-28 22:31:20	Appledawgs	soo im looking for a mobo that is for sure compatible with the ryzen 2nd gen !!

2018-07-28 22:31:29	mituna	so what that means is if the motherboard came out before your processor was released its possible that you will need to update the bios (aka you have to buy a compatible cpu and return it (or keep it))
2018-07-28 22:31:50	Appledawgs	this is the only site that ive found which says these are compatible
2018-07-28 22:32:14	Appledawgs	is it possible for a motherboard which i can use straight away
2018-07-28 22:32:17	Appledawgs	like drop in and use
2018-07-28 22:32:26	Appledawgs	oops, as in how do i find one
2018-07-28 22:34:05	mituna	so depending on what board you get they can come with any number of system BIOS's depending on the exact date of mfg an identical board in an identical box sealed may support the cpu and the same board in another box may not.

2018-07-28 22:36:18	Appledawgs	ok, thats perfect
2018-07-28 22:36:20	Appledawgs	thanks!!
2018-07-28 22:36:31	mituna	so take a sample from that list if the "B350M Mortar" were made on jan1  it would have bios v1.00
2018-07-28 22:36:46	mituna	if the cpu was made on jan2 it would require bios v1.01
2018-07-28 22:37:07	mituna	if the "B350M Mortar" was made on jan 30th it would have bios v1.05 and therefore support the chip

2018-07-28 22:37:35	@DoctorDick	EVGA B series and Corsair CX series are really bad PSUs
2018-07-28 22:37:46	@DoctorDick	You should never buy a PSU based on the brand

2018-07-28 22:43:00	mituna	depending on when the board was made and what bios was applied during its mfg process will determine if the cpu will be supported

2018-07-28 22:45:38	NiftFox	ill stick with the 750 then
2018-07-28 22:45:38	mituna	@nit yes, a 600 would be sufficent the rule of thumb i give is whatever your peak wattage could ever get to + 40%

2018-07-28 23:01:50	Appledawgs	are you able to take a look at my parts
2018-07-28 23:01:54	mituna	your machine will be able to power through most loads your throw at it, OC shouldnt be necessary, AM4 will be around for a long time so i dont think you need to worry
2018-07-28 23:02:27	mituna	you need a WAY better psu
2018-07-28 23:02:50	mituna	~650w
2018-07-28 23:03:06	mituna	trying to avoid naming names
2018-07-28 23:03:09	Appledawgs	?!?! really
2018-07-28 23:03:22	Appledawgs	but the estimate tdp is 300w
2018-07-28 23:04:04	mituna	psu efficency is not calculated, fans are neglected, LED's, cooler fans, etc all get forgotten about
2018-07-28 23:04:27	mituna	not to mention if you decided to push upto new hardware you would need to replace the psu
2018-07-28 23:04:30	Appledawgs	ooh that does make a lot of sense
2018-07-28 23:05:00	Appledawgs	so how many watts should i be aiming at
2018-07-28 23:05:02	mituna	not to mention $75 for a....
2018-07-28 23:05:05	mituna	ooooooooh
2018-07-28 23:05:11	mituna	Australia :(
2018-07-28 23:05:13	mituna	sorry for your loss
2018-07-28 23:05:17	Appledawgs	:(((
2018-07-28 23:06:04	Appledawgs	soo should i be looking at around 650w
2018-07-28 23:06:24	mituna	yea that gives you a bit of overhead and room for OC later
2018-07-28 23:06:53	Appledawgs	do i just pick one with good reviews hehe
2018-07-28 23:07:12	Appledawgs	damn i totally blew out my budget
2018-07-28 23:07:40	mituna	do they have craigslist down under?
2018-07-28 23:08:18	Appledawgs	yeeeeaaaahhh??
2018-07-28 23:08:24	Appledawgs	but id rather something not dodgy
2018-07-28 23:08:53	mituna	ehhhhhhhhhhhhh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-07-28 23:09:05	mituna	i buy everything used because im usuially confident i can fix it

2018-07-28 23:10:04	mituna	i cloned your build on the us side
2018-07-28 23:10:21	mituna	$912.29 aud
2018-07-28 23:10:27	Appledawgs	this is not fair
2018-07-28 23:10:32	Appledawgs	what the heck
2018-07-28 23:10:34	Appledawgs	whys it so cheap
2018-07-28 23:10:36	mituna	fly to singapore damn
2018-07-28 23:10:55	mituna	like you could legitimately just fly to china buy the crap and fly back for that price
2018-07-28 23:11:02	Appledawgs	hey umm
2018-07-28 23:11:08	Appledawgs	have i told you im going to china in like november
2018-07-28 23:11:27	mituna	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-07-28 23:11:30	Appledawgs	should i buy the stuff there
2018-07-28 23:11:39	mituna	im not going to tell you to do that
2018-07-28 23:11:53	Appledawgs	china is a bit dodgy if i say so myself
2018-07-28 23:11:55	Appledawgs	dammit
2018-07-28 23:12:03	mituna	but when dealing with that kind of stupid markup id be looking into sketchy
2018-07-28 23:13:43	Appledawgs	i might just buy it in australia then
2018-07-28 23:13:56	Appledawgs	would i need any extra case fans? my case does come with one fan at the back already
2018-07-28 23:14:41	mituna	your build is high end enough its going to put out a lot of heat
2018-07-28 23:14:46	mituna	you may not need to fill the case
2018-07-28 23:14:52	mituna	but having one extra will help temps a lot
2018-07-28 23:15:14	Appledawgs	dammit ive blown this build way out of proportion
2018-07-28 23:16:24	mituna	so TLDR heres what i advise for a build
2018-07-28 23:17:19	mituna	Ryzen 5 or i5 - 16gb ram - any ssd - 1tb hdd - 600w psu - gpu of atleast a 970 or higher - whatever case you want
2018-07-28 23:17:39	mituna	follow that super rough guide you will get a good machine at a fair price
2018-07-28 23:17:47	mituna	dont go flashy when building mid range
2018-07-28 23:18:09	Appledawgs	dammit
2018-07-28 23:18:20	Appledawgs	ive been choosing an aesthetic case and mobo/gpu with rgb

2018-07-29 06:48:18	Nathan	this might be a stupid question but if the ram is higher than the max limit on the CPU, will it not work? could this be the problem?

2018-07-29 10:37:12	@deww	you might get more info on why with -v or stack a few more -vs
2018-07-29 10:37:37	potatofuggerbutt	deww: that's the exact method that is suboptimal, I prefer it to basically become "Notepad.exe" however, when "Notepad.exe" is called it's tricked to open notepad++ instead. I prefer it that way, the way I had it, but the shit online isn't working and sites are being blocked because of some stupid filter I have on
2018-07-29 10:37:43	random52	how can i check if ssh is enabled and if port 22 is opened
2018-07-29 10:38:20	MikeFromIT	You'd have to have some sort of way to access it

2018-07-29 10:38:52	@deww	potatofuggerbutt: 100% sub-optimal, but not sure how'd you'd achieve that
2018-07-29 10:39:14	@deww	regedit to change associations is what's common
2018-07-29 10:39:27	potatofuggerbutt	via the scripts I used, well, script, singular. One powershell script, very few lines.
2018-07-29 10:40:29	potatofuggerbutt	I have to fucking do this manually now? Tf
2018-07-29 10:40:32	@deww	random52: ssh -v root@proxy might give you clues like ssh headers
2018-07-29 10:40:35	@deww	ssh banner even
2018-07-29 10:40:54	@deww	potatofuggerbutt: nah regedit files or ps scripts should be to do the same.

2018-07-29 12:31:07	detseb	hey guys! i have issue with jittery/choppy game on windows 10 didnt happen on my old OS 8.1 its only when theres apps running on background that are not minimized... even if i close all the apps the steam message window will give me jitters/choppy movements. I always have to keep everything closed.. anyone know why?
2018-07-29 12:31:56	VenatoS	This weird started happening out of no where, I was away from my PC for two weeks and when I came back, suddenly the sound on my PC is weirdly distorted, on both audio ports (Top of PC case, and the back panel). I have also tested a few different headsets + my speakers all sound distorted.
2018-07-29 12:31:57	VenatoS	So i will list a few things i have tried to not wasted everybody's time.
2018-07-29 12:31:57	VenatoS	- Reinstalling audio drivers (Didn't fix)
2018-07-29 12:31:57	VenatoS	- Installing different audio drivers (It caused the sound to not be distorted, but left speakers didn't work anymore & the bass didn't produce any.. bass. & Headsets were weirdly quite + produce sound with low quality)
2018-07-29 12:31:57	VenatoS	- Disabling all sound effects etc in Sound Panel.
2018-07-29 12:31:57	VenatoS	- Fixing all registry problems.
2018-07-29 12:31:57	VenatoS	- I tried the restore to point thing which also didn't prove effective.

2018-07-29 13:35:44	startopiaidiot	hi all, i'm having trouble with mouse sensitivity on my laptop. when i boot up the game 'startopia', because it's an old game it changes my resolution. when i close the game after playing, my mouse sensitivity becomes super slow and won't go back to normal unless i restart my laptop. is there any way of fixing it without having to restart?
2018-07-29 13:36:35	danpraux	have you tried changing the mouse sensitivity from the mouse settings to see if it resets it?
2018-07-29 13:36:47	startopiaidiot	i did try that and it didn't fix it
2018-07-29 13:37:06	startopiaidiot	it's the touchpad rather than the mouse, sorry, not sure if that changes anything
2018-07-29 13:38:01	danpraux	have you tried uninstalling touchpad drivers to see if it presists?
2018-07-29 13:38:31	startopiaidiot	i can give that a go - would i lose multi tap functionality, pinch zoom if i did that?
2018-07-29 13:38:54	danpraux	yes, probably. is it a synaptics driver?

2018-07-29 20:42:46	Brinks	Anyone know of an app or driver that supports using a spare android phone as webcam with audio? IPWebcam was recommended by many but apparently according the information on that screen shot it can only be used with 240p and no audio...
2018-07-29 20:43:16	Brinks	I don't really have a need for a webcam on this pc and I couldn't find my old one so figured i'd go this route...
2018-07-29 20:43:38	Brinks	but someone on facebook tried to video call me and the stupid site would not even allow me to answer so that i could see them and type back
2018-07-29 20:44:28	Brinks	if I'm going to set this up, I might as well get a solution that allows me to use it as a microphone also right?

2018-07-29 21:46:43	Brinks	Windows is so derpy sometimes... couldn't see its own boot media.
2018-07-29 21:46:57	@Eisenstein	that is the bios
2018-07-29 21:46:57	Brinks	funniest part? I can see all the files on the raid just fine
2018-07-29 21:47:07	Brinks	so the driver shouldn't be needed
2018-07-29 21:47:22	Brinks	im actually going to put the drive on my raid out of spite
2018-07-29 21:47:24	@Eisenstein	why are you installing an OS on a raid?
2018-07-29 21:47:26	Brinks	driver*
2018-07-29 21:47:58	@Eisenstein	the raid holds data, the os should be on a throwaway drive
2018-07-29 21:48:06	@Eisenstein	cheap SSD if possible
2018-07-29 21:48:31	@Eisenstein	you can get a 120gb sandisk SSD for $30 on amazonh
2018-07-29 21:48:52	Brinks	I have 3 ssds...
2018-07-29 21:48:57	Brinks	2 of them are raided
2018-07-29 21:49:03	@Eisenstein	what?
2018-07-29 21:49:07	Brinks	I dont want to touch the one by itself
2018-07-29 21:49:08	@Eisenstein	why?>
2018-07-29 21:49:16	@Eisenstein	why are you raiding SSDs
2018-07-29 21:49:18	@whitewolf	yu know, that error shows up in other situations than not seeing the storage controller
2018-07-29 21:49:27	Brinks	so i can go back to win10 as needed by enabling/hiding that ssd in my bios
2018-07-29 21:49:39	@Eisenstein	there is a thing called macrium reflect
2018-07-29 21:49:42	Brinks	mostly to learn, but also for speed

2018-07-29 21:49:58	Brinks	yeah i have that its a slow process though I don't fully trust it
2018-07-29 21:50:04	@Eisenstein	slow>
2018-07-29 21:50:14	Brinks	takes about 10 seconds to go into bios and hide my m.2 connector
2018-07-29 21:50:17	Brinks	and reboot
2018-07-29 21:50:20	@Eisenstein	a 30GB os install images in 5 mins on usb 3
2018-07-29 21:51:32	Brinks	I don't mean as a restore/backup like dualboot
2018-07-29 21:51:59	Brinks	im not sure i trust myself to try an actual dual boot going from 10 to 7... i can barely get dualboot to work it mostly happens out of luck
2018-07-29 21:52:28	Brinks	like the last 3 or 4 times i installed i could go back to all my previous versions just by hitting the down arrow during boot
2018-07-29 21:52:35	Brinks	this last time i lost all those
2018-07-29 21:52:52	@Eisenstein	you know that m,2 connectirs are rated for 20-60 cycles
2018-07-29 21:52:55	Brinks	so i've taken to physically removing or bios hiding drives

2018-07-29 21:58:16	kikoman	not sure if the enclosurer is not compatible, broken or if i am doing something wrong i thought this would be much more straightforward and plug and play
2018-07-29 21:58:19	Brinks	"i bought a new WD  4 TB red drive and mounted it in a 3.5 enclosure and i only seem USB 3 device " can you elaborate?

2018-07-29 21:58:36	kikoman	how do i do that?

2018-07-29 22:03:02	kikoman	so now what should i do ,i plan on using this   connected to my  asus routers USB 3.0 port
2018-07-29 22:03:08	Brinks	if he is taking a 3.5 4tb wd red and putting it in a usb enclosure then it showing as a usb drive that is normal
2018-07-29 22:03:18	@Eisenstein	it is formated and partitioned, just plug it in
2018-07-29 22:03:34	Brinks	and afaik apart from firmware hacks there is very little chance of spoofing it as a normal sata drive to the os
2018-07-29 22:03:48	kikoman	i don't know i just unboxed a brand new WD red and put it in a 3.5 USB 3.0 enclosure
2018-07-29 22:03:49	@Eisenstein	he wants to plug it into his router 
2018-07-29 22:04:19	@Eisenstein	the drive is ready, if the router can read it you are good to go

2018-07-29 22:05:20	kikoman	why?

2018-07-29 22:20:04	kikoman	also if i wanted to later repartition the drive using something like partiton magic  would i be able to and do it over my LAN or would i need to connect the drive to my PC,i hav enot repartitioned a drive with data on it in a while
2018-07-29 22:20:28	@Eisenstein	why would you want to reparition your drive>
2018-07-29 22:20:34	@Eisenstein	also, no, you cannot do it over lan
2018-07-29 22:21:25	Brinks	could  you actually replace a full NAS with that? like 7 port USB 3.0 hub and multiple drives?
2018-07-29 22:21:32	@Eisenstein	btw, as someone who does data recovery, dont put anything on that 4TB drive you really care about

2018-07-29 22:21:44	@Eisenstein	no Brinks
2018-07-29 22:21:50	kikoman	why is that?

2018-07-29 22:22:33	@Eisenstein	it works

2018-07-29 22:22:43	@Eisenstein	because you will lose it
2018-07-29 22:22:45	kikoman	it si ared drive what would be the problem?
2018-07-29 22:22:53	@Eisenstein	no it is the 4TB drive
2018-07-29 22:22:57	kikoman	i figured  you mean that but how
2018-07-29 22:23:01	kikoman	because no raid
2018-07-29 22:23:10	kikoman	or because of something else?
2018-07-29 22:23:21	@Eisenstein	hard drives work not like records where they play linear, they stripe data on all platters
2018-07-29 22:23:36	@Eisenstein	the more platters the more striping.  if one platter has issues you lose ALL your data
2018-07-29 22:24:05	@Eisenstein	it is like writing a book and giving every second lind of the page to a different person and hoping they dont die
2018-07-29 22:24:10	kikoman	dumb it down for me

2018-07-29 22:24:26	@Eisenstein	no
2018-07-29 22:24:36	@Eisenstein	I am saying if you care about the data you should have multiple drives
2018-07-29 22:24:41	@Eisenstein	and mirror the content
2018-07-29 22:24:46	kikoman	no iema like  really dumb  lie=ke why is this different in this configuraiotn
2018-07-29 22:24:58	kikoman	i know that
2018-07-29 22:24:59	@Eisenstein	imagine how much data is 4TB
2018-07-29 22:25:03	kikoman	but i do not need raid

2018-07-29 23:14:48	@whitewolf	if you're swappoing, have a bad disk, have another hardware problem, etc could be the issue
2018-07-29 23:14:55	Brinks	you can get usually same price on 2 stick instead of 1 then its much more efficient memory usage in general
2018-07-29 23:15:16	@whitewolf	yeah, dual channel is slightly faster in bandwidth tests
2018-07-29 23:15:17	Brinks	also he has a motherboard with a bad ram slot
2018-07-29 23:15:21	Brinks	think about that
2018-07-29 23:15:32	@whitewolf	yeah that's why a hardware test makes sense
2018-07-29 23:16:08	VortexGuy	doing it right now
2018-07-29 23:16:21	Brinks	either way you are taking a risk running this motherboard
2018-07-29 23:16:40	VortexGuy	what do you mean
2018-07-29 23:16:43	Brinks	nvm
2018-07-29 23:16:51	Brinks	lets see how the test goes
2018-07-29 23:17:12	@whitewolf	most of the benchmarks i'm sifting through here suggest a 1050Ti will drop to about 45fps on Epic at 1080p
2018-07-29 23:17:21	@whitewolf	as an average
2018-07-29 23:17:59	Brinks	I honestly did not realize some people use single channel.
2018-07-29 23:18:34	@whitewolf	it's not as sinful as it used tro be
2018-07-29 23:18:51	Brinks	but dem benchmarks
2018-07-29 23:19:04	@Eisenstein	the problem is that most mobos only have 4-6 slots
2018-07-29 23:19:05	Brinks	yay for synthetics
2018-07-29 23:19:15	@whitewolf	microbenchmarks are useful for some kinds of testing
2018-07-29 23:19:25	@whitewolf	but it's hard to get their results to show in meaningful workloads a lot of times
2018-07-29 23:19:30	Brinks	imagine a block of external ram, maybe would need fiber
2018-07-29 23:19:36	Brinks	optical transfer
2018-07-29 23:19:38	@Eisenstein	what>
2018-07-29 23:19:55	@whitewolf	the biggest problem would actually be latency
2018-07-29 23:19:56	Brinks	like 3 rubics cubes stacked
2018-07-29 23:19:58	@Eisenstein	you know that electrical conduits work at the speed of light as well
2018-07-29 23:20:17	@whitewolf	we have high speed links (40Gbit Thunderbolt 3, for instance at 5GB/s) -- but the latency is very high
2018-07-29 23:20:41	@Eisenstein	i like to explain latency to people as follows
2018-07-29 23:20:46	@whitewolf	that, along with a bit of bandwidth constriction, leads to eGPUs being only ~70% of in-machine 
2018-07-29 23:21:05	@Eisenstein	give somneone a 4TB hard drive and have them drive from NYC to LA

2018-07-29 23:21:21	@Eisenstein	when they get there you have 4TB bandwidth, but 3 days latency
2018-07-29 23:21:36	@whitewolf	why bother?
2018-07-29 23:21:44	Brinks	747 of microsds
2018-07-29 23:21:45	@Eisenstein	just get an ssd
2018-07-29 23:21:49	Brinks	few hrs latency

2018-07-29 23:42:48	@Eisenstein	In a balanced line, the two wires carry equal and opposite signals, and the destination detects the difference between the two. This is known as differential signaling. Noise sources introduce signals into the wires by coupling of electric or magnetic fields and tend to couple to both wires equally. The noise thus produces a common-mode signal which can be canceled at the receiver when the difference signal is taken.
2018-07-29 23:43:07	@Eisenstein	amazing, right>
2018-07-29 23:45:05	@Eisenstein	USB device communication is based on pipes (logical channels). A pipe is a connection from the host controller to a logical entity, found on a device, and named an endpoint. Because pipes correspond to endpoints, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A USB device could have up to 32 endpoints (16 IN, 16 OUT), though it is rare to have so many. An endpoint is defined and numbered by the device during initialization (the p
2018-07-29 23:45:06	@Eisenstein	eriod after physical connection called "enumeration") and so is relatively permanent, whereas a pipe may be opened and closed.
2018-07-29 23:45:26	@Eisenstein	this is why you cant just split a usb signal

2018-07-30 00:10:24	Bagma	umm
2018-07-30 00:10:30	Bagma	what do i do when i get in the program
2018-07-30 00:11:00	Bagma	@eisenstein
2018-07-30 00:12:15	Brinks	yeah thats another reason for the 65% ram usage i guess
2018-07-30 00:12:32	Brinks	still highly recommend a stable board with all working slots and 16gb dual channel
2018-07-30 00:12:52	Bagma	so should i buy a new board?
2018-07-30 00:13:12	Bagma	i mean
2018-07-30 00:13:19	Bagma	ik the answer
2018-07-30 00:13:31	Bagma	but can you send an amazon link for an affordable one?
2018-07-30 00:13:46	Brinks	when it comes to random parts not working to be being a recipe for disaster the mobo is probably the most important
2018-07-30 00:14:34	Brinks	just to even use your same os and hard drive again on a new board if it dies is difficult
2018-07-30 00:14:50	Brinks	so you'd likely have to reinstall windows
2018-07-30 00:15:14	Brinks	with a working system you can do some driver/prep work beforehand
2018-07-30 00:16:05	@Eisenstein	WRONG
2018-07-30 00:16:11	@Eisenstein	BRINKS YOU LOSE
2018-07-30 00:16:17	@Eisenstein	it is the PSU
2018-07-30 00:16:21	@Eisenstein	no the mobo
2018-07-30 00:16:28	Bagma	whats psu again?
2018-07-30 00:16:35	@Eisenstein	power supply unit
2018-07-30 00:16:43	Brinks	he has a non functioning ram slot
2018-07-30 00:16:51	Bagma	i do..
2018-07-30 00:16:53	Brinks	that could be caused by a bad psu tho you're rigth
2018-07-30 00:17:05	Brinks	so it might be worth testing the old one
2018-07-30 00:17:10	@Eisenstein	try de-oxit
2018-07-30 00:17:17	Bagma	excuse me?
2018-07-30 00:17:19	@Eisenstein	.g de-oxit d5

2018-07-30 00:17:41	@Eisenstein	i live by it
2018-07-30 00:18:12	Bagma	i dont get how this relates to my ram slot
2018-07-30 00:18:23	@Eisenstein	because your contacts might be corroded
2018-07-30 00:19:04	@Eisenstein	spray it with de-oxit, I will bet you 500 zimbabwae dollars it fixes it

2018-07-30 00:27:46	@Eisenstein	oxidization is like rust
2018-07-30 00:27:48	@Eisenstein	or fire
2018-07-30 00:27:54	@Eisenstein	fire is just oxidization
2018-07-30 00:28:00	@Eisenstein	this is why creating rust makes heat
2018-07-30 00:28:12	Bagma	i think i got it
2018-07-30 00:28:13	@Eisenstein	now they use brass

2018-07-30 00:28:31	@Eisenstein	it turns green
2018-07-30 00:28:43	@Eisenstein	this green shit is like rust
2018-07-30 00:28:49	@Eisenstein	it prevents electrical contacts
2018-07-30 00:29:00	@Eisenstein	deoxit removes it

2018-07-30 14:06:56	Mikeee|e	yes.
2018-07-30 14:06:59	@Mandevwin	yall, it sounds like your gpu has failed. test it in another computer
2018-07-30 14:07:12	yall	but why did it fail
2018-07-30 14:07:21	yall	i just cleaned it
2018-07-30 14:07:27	yall	and then it failed makes no sense
2018-07-30 14:07:39	Mikeee|e	you likely damaged it while cleaning it
2018-07-30 14:07:43	yall	and how can it show bios if it failed
2018-07-30 14:07:45	Mikeee|e	makes perfect sense
2018-07-30 14:07:54	yall	but how can it show bios?
2018-07-30 14:08:03	Mikeee|e	BIOS uses the very basics of the GPU's features
2018-07-30 14:08:03	@PipeItToDevNull	Failure is not binary 
2018-07-30 14:08:10	yall	oh
2018-07-30 14:08:19	@Mandevwin	exactly. if you were to fully uninstall the gpu's drivers from the os, it would work
2018-07-30 14:08:25	yall	Can i ask another question?
2018-07-30 14:08:26	Mikeee|e	test the gpu in another system

2018-07-30 14:08:29	@Mandevwin	but it would only work in vga mode, which is terrible resolution
2018-07-30 14:08:35	@Mandevwin	it will also likely work in safe mode
2018-07-30 14:08:45	yall	It doesnt mandewin i tried
2018-07-30 14:08:58	Mikeee|e	how did you get to safe mode if it only works in bios

2018-07-30 16:43:07	Alc	Hey guys.  I'm trying to clean up a work network nightmare.  I took over the IT Position and the previous guy left no documentation.  We have 6 or so routers installed throughout the building.  One of them is serving as a DHCP server (I imagine).  Whats the best way to find out which one is serving as DHCP?  Trying to connect to it via gateway ip i
2018-07-30 16:43:07	Alc	s not working.
2018-07-30 16:43:31	Alc	I need to be able to access the router settings so I can update wifi passwords, etc.
2018-07-30 16:48:09	MikeFromIT	If you need to change passwords just log into all of them and check which one has it enabled when you're signed into it Alc
2018-07-30 16:51:14	Alc	Thats the problem, I CANT sign into them.  When I try to access them via the gateway IP, it fails to connect.  I guess I could walk around the building trying to hard wire into every single one of them and testing it, but I was hoping there would be a way to discover it via software.
2018-07-30 16:52:02	Alc	This whole thing is further complicated by the fact that we run out network off a VPN network provided by the school district that owns the building we utilize

2018-07-30 17:39:44	Jupz	Hey guys. Since about two weeks i get blackscreens mostly in loading screens ingame (WoW). After restarting i get the error message that there has been an error starting the display driver. I tried updating/changing drivers, backups and an entire wipe of the system with a clean reinstall. appreciate any help, thanks!
2018-07-30 17:40:50	@whitewolf	perhaps hardware failure

2018-07-30 17:43:26	Jupz	thanks for the link, will give it a try. Any idea what in particular it could be? Been think its my ssd but seems unlikely since its only happening ingame and almost always during loading screens?
2018-07-30 17:44:40	@whitewolf	could be
2018-07-30 17:44:43	@whitewolf	let's get a speccy as well

2018-07-30 17:46:11	@Mandevwin	Jupz, we need to diagnose to tell what it is, but in my experience it is likely gpu related or software related
2018-07-30 17:48:05	@whitewolf	indeed
2018-07-30 17:48:13	@whitewolf	guessing based on symptoms is only so much fun
2018-07-30 17:48:35	@Mandevwin	when there's money on the line it is
2018-07-30 17:48:44	@Mandevwin	my money is on gpu failure 
2018-07-30 17:48:52	@whitewolf	that's why i went for the hwinfo first
2018-07-30 17:48:56	@whitewolf	especially with the display driver crashing
2018-07-30 17:49:01	@Mandevwin	no i called it

2018-07-30 17:53:22	@TechSupport	"Killer NIC" drivers are known to cause high memory usage. In the following order: (1) Download the latest drivers from: https://goo.gl/FkJk8t (2) Remove any "Killer" software using the uninstaller and (3) install your newly downloaded drivers.
2018-07-30 17:53:29	@Mandevwin	FYI. may not be related
2018-07-30 17:53:37	@whitewolf	it may be related
2018-07-30 17:53:40	@Mandevwin	i know
2018-07-30 17:53:47	@whitewolf	the graphics driver will crash if it can't get any wired memory
2018-07-30 17:53:51	@Mandevwin	drivers can crash if there are memory errrors
2018-07-30 17:54:02	@whitewolf	fix his killer problem first then have him run hwinfo
2018-07-30 17:54:05	@whitewolf	i need to afk a few
2018-07-30 17:54:08	@whitewolf	you called the problem anyway

2018-07-30 17:54:14	@Mandevwin	meh i called hardware
2018-07-30 17:54:21	@whitewolf	so do the work to prove it

2018-07-30 17:54:34	reddead	So i'm trying to create a hotkey for my snippet tool, but it just doesn't seem to work. I was able to go into properties>shortcut>(create shortcut key) however when I try to use it, nothing happens.
2018-07-30 17:54:40	@whitewolf	poo
2018-07-30 17:54:43	reddead	Anyone have any idea why that may be?
2018-07-30 17:54:43	@Mandevwin	then run a hwinfo log with prime95 and hwinfo
2018-07-30 17:55:15	@whitewolf	alright i'll stick near my pc then
2018-07-30 17:55:27	@Mandevwin	reddead, may try to use autohotkey instead
2018-07-30 17:55:27	@whitewolf	convient that you get to go home now ;p
2018-07-30 17:55:36	Jupz	okay, doing the killer thing and then onto hwinfo

2018-07-30 18:50:07	Eric11	Hello I just watched video on how to clean install windows 10 and it went succesfull but in the "collecting information" phase of the install he told me to split my drive in two partitions.  I did this and installed windows on smaller half (200gb) and booted it up, like he said to do.  when i was in the rest of my hard drive 1600gb was no where to 
2018-07-30 18:50:08	Eric11	be found.
2018-07-30 18:50:33	@PipeItToDevNull	open disk mangement 
2018-07-30 18:50:38	Eric11	im doing the clean install again and wondering if i can merge the two partitions
2018-07-30 18:50:42	@PipeItToDevNull	make a new partition in the space 
2018-07-30 18:50:46	@PipeItToDevNull	Format NTFS 
2018-07-30 18:50:53	@PipeItToDevNull	Give it a letter and store shit there 
2018-07-30 18:51:07	@PipeItToDevNull	I consider that best practice, to separate data from the OS 
2018-07-30 18:51:10	Eric11	okay so idk how to format
2018-07-30 18:51:19	@PipeItToDevNull	With the right click 
2018-07-30 18:51:25	Eric11	the C drive wasnt formatted either i think

2018-07-30 18:51:34	@PipeItToDevNull	It has to be 
2018-07-30 18:52:00	Eric11	well i just went through the media installation tool for usb and it wokrked
2018-07-30 18:52:05	@PipeItToDevNull	You are not understanding drives and partitions. Your C: is a partition on a drive, you made two partitions. You have C:, you are booted on it. You need to make a D: now 
2018-07-30 18:52:21	@PipeItToDevNull	That is where you will store bulk data 
2018-07-30 18:52:27	Eric11	is there a benefit to doing this than having one large drive?
2018-07-30 18:52:31	@PipeItToDevNull	You can remap docs, downloads, etc to there 
2018-07-30 18:52:35	@PipeItToDevNull	I consider that best practice, to separate data from the OS 
2018-07-30 18:52:55	Eric11	should i make the c partition smaller than 200gbs then?
2018-07-30 18:53:10	@PipeItToDevNull	You cna wipe the OS without your personal shit, it speeds up recoveries and avoids the classic "I cant install, all my shit will be gone" 
2018-07-30 18:53:22	@PipeItToDevNull	I would use about 60GB for a C: on Windows 
2018-07-30 18:53:29	Eric11	okay
2018-07-30 18:53:29	@PipeItToDevNull	But, that depends on use 
2018-07-30 18:53:47	@PipeItToDevNull	That also does not excuse your from backups 
2018-07-30 18:54:15	Eric11	well im reinstalling completly again because i deleted the partition because i thought i messed up
2018-07-30 18:54:28	@PipeItToDevNull	What partition 
2018-07-30 18:54:29	Eric11	is there a way to merge all partitions and then ill make my c drive 60 gb

2018-07-30 18:54:37	Eric11	C
2018-07-30 18:54:38	Jupz	screw i mean
2018-07-30 18:54:48	@PipeItToDevNull	Eric11, are you not booted into the machine right now?
2018-07-30 18:54:52	Eric11	no
2018-07-30 18:55:07	Eric11	im in the process of instillation
2018-07-30 18:55:15	@PipeItToDevNull	Then yes, just boot, delete all the shit, make two partitions 
2018-07-30 18:55:34	Eric11	deleted it all and theyre not merging into a single partition
2018-07-30 18:55:59	@PipeItToDevNull	That is not possible 
2018-07-30 18:56:06	@PipeItToDevNull	You didnt delete something

2018-07-30 19:07:08	@TechSupport	YAY!
2018-07-30 19:07:11	hey21	You should even be able to format it while you're installing
2018-07-30 19:07:36	Eric11	im gonna stay in here so i can get help formatting when it is time
2018-07-30 19:08:10	Eric11	in that C drive should i have stuff like discord and chrome and small but daily used stuff>
2018-07-30 19:08:11	Eric11	?
2018-07-30 19:08:24	Jupz	okay so there is no way i can see what exact psu i have without a screwdriver for the screw and i can't do that right now. You are saying its very likely the psu? note that it almost always happens at the start of loading screens ingame, can that be related?
2018-07-30 19:08:29	@PipeItToDevNull	they will all install there by default and wont amount to much space 
2018-07-30 19:08:54	@PipeItToDevNull	Jupz, it is low in voltage, it would fail once put under load 
2018-07-30 19:10:44	Jupz	so going in a loading screen does put it under load? i'd assue that lets say complex scenes/situations ingame or out of it would do that right?
2018-07-30 19:11:41	@PipeItToDevNull	whitewolf, thinks GPU failure based on what was said, the PSU is also at the low end of compliance. I would test with another PSU then go after the GPU idea

2018-07-30 19:18:25	@PipeItToDevNull	Or does it require mouse interaction 
2018-07-30 19:18:43	hey21	snipping tool will take full screen screenshots without mouse interaction, or it will allow you to drag a mouse
2018-07-30 19:18:51	reddead	it allows a mouse drag

2018-07-30 19:35:18	hey21	up to you
2018-07-30 19:35:21	hey21	it is easy to save user data
2018-07-30 19:35:44	hey21	you can create another NTFS partition, and move the C:\…\Users\YourName\ folders over to it
2018-07-30 19:35:53	Marsupilami	yeah.... but kinda anoygin need to boot every time when it pops up
2018-07-30 19:35:58	hey21	and then move the relevant appdata over, it is saved in that same user folder but it has a period in front of it so it is a hidden directory
2018-07-30 19:36:11	Marsupilami	have on external most of it
2018-07-30 19:36:15	hey21	then when you reinstall Windows, don't erase that partition, and move it back over

2018-07-30 21:15:23	kngpin	but i never formatted this dive in MBR it was formatted  to GPT NTFS
2018-07-30 21:16:04	kngpin	how did it get MBR?
2018-07-30 21:16:09	kngpin	the router?

2018-07-30 21:16:31	@PipeItToDevNull	Does it work with a GPT disk? It may have no clue what to do with more than 2TB 
2018-07-30 21:17:58	kngpin	i used diskmgmt to format it to  one large partition  GPT NTFS  all default setting , it was brand new, then i put it in my router after that
2018-07-30 21:18:12	@PipeItToDevNull	Where do you see that it is now MBR 
2018-07-30 21:18:45	kngpin	the link  posted was for  conveting MBR to whatever that is
2018-07-30 21:18:47	@PipeItToDevNull	Also, did they say format it that way 
2018-07-30 21:18:52	kngpin	GPT

2018-07-30 21:21:13	kngpin	how do i tell if  it is GPT?
2018-07-30 21:21:19	@PipeItToDevNull	Did you not use my link to accomplish a GPT disk with no partitions 
2018-07-30 21:21:32	kngpin	i have no idea what i am doing
2018-07-30 21:21:59	@PipeItToDevNull	That page has commands, to clean the disk and make it GPT with no partitions 
2018-07-30 21:22:16	kngpin	so i can not do it in diskmgmnt

2018-07-30 21:27:17	@PipeItToDevNull	does it show different in disk mangement if you close and re-open it?
2018-07-30 21:28:21	kngpin	yes ,3725.90GB unallocated
2018-07-30 21:28:31	kngpin	so i should plug it in the router now?

2018-07-30 21:44:36	@PipeItToDevNull	I would use a real NAS 
2018-07-30 21:44:38	kngpin	so  it would need to be partitioned with therouter or  could i partition it with  windows to 2 TV partitions

2018-07-30 21:45:01	kngpin	*2 2TB partitions
2018-07-30 21:45:22	@PipeItToDevNull	Plug a USB into the thing and see if it fundamentally works 
2018-07-30 21:45:34	kngpin	i donlt think it has any option to format it to  2 partitions in the software and probably would only  see one
2018-07-30 21:46:19	kngpin	i have a smaller drive ,brand new but not a red or NAS  hardy drive
2018-07-30 21:47:13	@PipeItToDevNull	meh, blue, red, black, it dies when it dies 
2018-07-30 21:48:05	kngpin	i know but i overpaid for this red drive
2018-07-30 21:48:21	kngpin	found out about the WD easystore shucking too late
2018-07-30 21:48:54	kngpin	and i would have gone for a  8TB if i knew the router was going to accept this drive
2018-07-30 21:49:21	@PipeItToDevNull	8TB of what 
2018-07-30 21:49:45	kngpin	i would have  got a WD easystore 8TB  Thailand made drive and  opened it up and checked if it was red inside and used that with an odroid or something
2018-07-30 21:50:05	kngpin	or got a WD drive with   ethernet
2018-07-30 21:50:25	@PipeItToDevNull	Those are a lot of single drive solutions 
2018-07-30 21:50:26	kngpin	my cloud , really donlt need a ful on NAS, like synology or qnap
2018-07-30 21:52:12	kngpin	this was going to be temporary till  SBC's get more powerful and cheaper
2018-07-30 21:53:05	kngpin	the NAS enclosures are all ridiculously overpriced and underpowered for what they charge
2018-07-30 21:54:14	kngpin	i was going to use the drive with the router  then upgrade to connecting it to a SBC later on

2018-07-30 23:30:32	kngpin	way over my head so what is th esolution ? fix it in on the client side by doing something in windows progrms and features? or  upgrade or downgrade SMB in the router?
2018-07-30 23:32:07	kngpin	i am on win 8.1 not  win 10
2018-07-30 23:32:38	@PipeItToDevNull	I am just saying it is a possibility, atm your root issue is no memory 
2018-07-30 23:33:25	kngpin	no memory where though? in the router?
2018-07-30 23:33:52	@PipeItToDevNull	yes 
2018-07-30 23:33:55	@PipeItToDevNull	That is what the error is 
2018-07-30 23:35:02	kngpin	i have no clue how router ram works or what can affect it, memory leaks? virus? other?
2018-07-30 23:35:20	kngpin	no clue how much ram a arouter is supposed to have or needs
2018-07-30 23:35:44	@PipeItToDevNull	it has 256MB, it runs out when reading your disk at 116MB 
2018-07-30 23:35:57	@PipeItToDevNull	The "OS" also needs some of that
2018-07-30 23:36:16	kngpin	what if  the HDD has a bigger cache?
2018-07-30 23:36:35	kngpin	maybe  it is too small
2018-07-30 23:36:46	kngpin	or does it not matter
2018-07-30 23:37:00	@PipeItToDevNull	no
2018-07-30 23:37:02	@PipeItToDevNull	Just RAM 
2018-07-30 23:38:04	kngpin	is 256 small for a router i really have no  idea what do nighthawks have
2018-07-30 23:38:34	kngpin	is a $500 rotuer goign to have gigs and gigs
2018-07-30 23:39:38	@Mikeee	at $500 you might as well just buy a PC
2018-07-30 23:39:57	kngpin	IKR
2018-07-30 23:40:13	@Mikeee	no you misunderstand
2018-07-30 23:40:25	kngpin	i am just  wondering what the range is for  router RAM
2018-07-30 23:40:25	@Mikeee	that's literally what you do
2018-07-30 23:40:47	@Mikeee	Anyone who needs performance from their router would just use a PC or server.
2018-07-30 23:41:08	@Mikeee	even a $10 thrift store router will outperform $400 routers
2018-07-30 23:41:19	kngpin	i would buy a SBC like odroid or something ,  something that does not boot from an SD thogh
2018-07-30 23:41:20	@Mikeee	even a $10 thrift store desktop as a router* will outperform $400 routers
2018-07-30 23:41:45	kngpin	true but it will have much more power consumption

2018-07-30 23:42:11	kngpin	my router aalways has to be on anyways ad has a  3.0 port
2018-07-30 23:42:18	@Mikeee	otherwise just grab a shitty pc
2018-07-30 23:43:10	@Mikeee	grab a laptop with a broken screen from ebay or craigslist, something super cheap. Underclock it, Make it a router.
2018-07-30 23:43:31	kngpin	why not use a SBC

2018-07-30 23:46:03	@Mikeee	perhaps install DDWRT or tomato
2018-07-30 23:46:37	kngpin	so you are saying the drive is not even initialized? i didn't think it would still show up in windows explorer if wasn't
2018-07-30 23:46:51	kngpin	no can do

2018-07-31 19:25:50	merkuree	for clarification, the cpu is currently running on this mobo but it's using the settings from my old fx 4300
2018-07-31 19:26:06	merkuree	msinfo tells me that it's running on 2 cores

2018-07-31 20:05:06	Guest521	I just had a problem with my internet/wifi. It randomly stops working in random intervals. In chrome in gives me a privacy error.
2018-07-31 20:06:53	Lynn25	Guest52: are you losing internet on your other devices
2018-07-31 20:07:52	Guest521	Yes all other devices, consoles, phones, etc. Nothing use an ethernet cord so I can't confirm if it's wifi or internet
2018-07-31 20:08:29	Lynn25	Can you connect your computer directly to your modem?
2018-07-31 20:09:35	Guest521	I don't have a cable to. Both the modem and router don't have flashing lights when it happens
2018-07-31 20:11:10	Lynn25	No lights at all?
2018-07-31 20:11:18	Lynn25	Not even a power light?
2018-07-31 20:11:39	Guest521	All that are normally lit stay lit
2018-07-31 20:11:55	Lynn25	What steps have you taken so far?
2018-07-31 20:11:57	Guest521	They just don'T flash or turn orange, sorry for the confusion
2018-07-31 20:12:06	Lynn25	So I don't start telling you to do the same thing
2018-07-31 20:12:18	Guest521	Reset the router
2018-07-31 20:13:25	Guest521	The wifi seems out of sync when it stops working. Ill get a message on my phone that I couldn't connect to the network
2018-07-31 20:13:40	Guest521	but it works for 2-5 minutes before it usually crashes after
2018-07-31 20:13:55	Lynn25	Do you have a modem router?
2018-07-31 20:14:08	Guest521	I have a modem connected to my router
2018-07-31 20:14:22	Guest521	I don't have the "hybrid" one
2018-07-31 20:14:24	Lynn25	Alrighty they are separate
2018-07-31 20:14:44	Lynn25	You've done the standard unplugging of both?
2018-07-31 20:15:11	Guest521	Not unplugging, no.
2018-07-31 20:15:44	Lynn25	Go ahead and do that. Unplug both from The power, wait 10 sec, then plug back in
2018-07-31 20:15:48	Guest521	But if that helps, chrome shows a "connection is not private error" rather than the usual no internet connection
2018-07-31 20:17:15	Guest521	Okay, will it boot me out of this chat? If so how can I get to talk to you again?
2018-07-31 20:17:42	Lynn25	No several things can cause that error not necessarily your internet going down. And since this is happening to several devices I imagine it's an unrelated issue.
2018-07-31 20:18:18	Lynn25	You can reconnect on your phone using mobile data. I'll be here regardless but there are several people here than can help.

I took some of it apart recently to clean it, and after that, sometimes when I start up my computer to play games the frame rate sucks and my audio is all crackly. Sometimes it works fine though. I am not sure what is causing it, could it be a hardware problem?

2018-07-31 23:15:15	DDDDDDDDD	I often have to start my pc several times before it will actually stay on. it just loses power within 5minutes of boot. this happens at different points of starting and theres no trigger that i can tell. Once it is full up and has been on for 10 minutes I can leave it on for days.  does this sound like a power supply issue?
2018-07-31 23:17:12	DDDDDDDDD	it always loads bios and at least attempts to start os, sometimes partially loads it, sometimes it powers of on login screen and sometimes it will load all the way into os but still powers off shortly after
2018-07-31 23:18:25	DDDDDDDDD	simple off/on doesn't do anything, pc will NOT power on at all until i full discharge all power and then try again

2018-08-01 19:39:23	misternumberone	hello, i have a system constructed in 2013 that has i7-4770K, 2x GTX 770 SLI, ASUS Maximus VI Hero, and Corsair CX750M PSU. however, it has a problem where when the CPU and GPU activity reaches a certain level, the computer resets and a message appears at POST "Asus anti-surge was triggered to protect system from unstable power supply". When the system was first constructed, overclocked and stress tested this did not 
2018-08-01 19:39:23	misternumberone	happen. The issue appeared gradually over several years and only recently got a lot worse. now i cannot play some games because soon after launching them the computer shuts down.
2018-08-01 19:40:27	misternumberone	on many forums some people say "the power supply is bad buy a better one" and many others say "asus anti surge is the problem, disable it in BIOS". So, I don't know really which I should do

2018-08-01 19:48:52	misternumberone	also when I was playing a source engine game with NVIDIA surround and SLI, the monitor connected to one of the GTX 770 started flickering and the colors went yellow. then the computer restarted to ASUS anti surge
2018-08-01 19:54:34	misternumberone	when the system was constructed, at first there were not many extra components or peripherals, and the leading power supply calculator at the time quoted 730 Watts. However over the years I added many more hard drives, DVD drives, USB devices, case fans and front bay panels. So, when encountering this problem the first thing I have done is remove all these extra components. However it has not solved the problem.

Its the dreaded microstutter. Every time i boot windows, I get persistent lag for a split second coupled with sound distortion a screen freeze. Sometimes i turn on my pc and the problem

2018-08-02 18:29:53	Tai	sorry this is my first time on this reddit due to a friend recommending it to me- that pastebin was kinda messy. but does anyone have any ideas on how I can fix a monitor resolution to be 2560 x 1440 when it used to work but now is stuck on 1980 x 1080

2018-08-02 18:43:38	Tai	Hi so I was here earlier with this problem: Hi, so I was playing video games on my desktop computer with two monitors, an ASUS 1920 x 1080 monitor and my Dell S2716DGR monitor on 2560 x 1440, when suddenly my resolution on the Dell monitor dropped to 1920 x 1080. I use an HDMI Dinger switch to switch the display from my PC to my PS4 and my Nintendo
2018-08-02 18:43:38	Tai	 Switch, so I thought maybe that might've been the issue but if I plug my computer directly into the monitor the highest resolution it can get to now is 1024 x 768. Does anyone know how I can fix my Dell monitor to display 2560 x 1440 again? Thank you for your time!
2018-08-02 18:44:05	Tai	and a nice gentlemen here told me to try and uninstall my display drivers and reinstall them, and I did, but it still didn't work

2018-08-02 20:04:22	LetsProgrammTheH	Having some issues with a dell laptop battery. Power manager lite tells me the battery needs to be replaced, and the power icon shows "82%(plugged in, not charging). Just launched into the dell bios, checked the battery info, and it shows a charge as well. All it says is "Health : communication error". This is preventing me from using the laptop on
2018-08-02 20:04:22	LetsProgrammTheH	 the battery power, as when I unplug the AC power, the laptop shuts off. Wondering if anyone knows if this is a hardware issues with the battery or MoBo. I don't want to buy a battery only to find out it fixes nothing
2018-08-02 20:06:31	@deww	if it's a replaceable battery, maybe check the contacts 
2018-08-02 20:06:38	@deww	but can't really tell based on that info alone
2018-08-02 20:07:43	LetsProgrammTheH	it is the battery that came with the laptop when bought directly from dell. I've checked for swelling, checked the cable that connects the battery to the MoBo, and the contacts on the MoBo and battery themselves. everything physically looks fine to my eye, but I don't have much experience with laptop batteries.
2018-08-02 20:08:10	LetsProgrammTheH	is there anymore info I could provide to help diagnose the issue?
2018-08-02 20:09:15	@deww	how long have you had the battery?
2018-08-02 20:09:21	@deww	or laptop?
2018-08-02 20:09:49	LetsProgrammTheH	laptop is 2 years old, but has only ran on the dell "Smart Charge" option, and has only been through around 150 cycles. Never let it get below 20%
2018-08-02 20:10:25	@deww	2 years is pretty decent for rechargable batteries, at least in my experience. 
2018-08-02 20:10:51	LetsProgrammTheH	it was my gaming dedicated machine so I tried to keep it unplugged as much as I could when I wasn't using it.
2018-08-02 20:12:28	LetsProgrammTheH	My $300 Asus has been running strong for about 5 years now so I was hoping this $800 gaming laptop would last a little longer than 2 years. especially since Dell doesn't even have new batteries in stock for this machine.
2018-08-02 20:13:12	LetsProgrammTheH	So should I just give a replacement battery a shot and see if that's the issue?
2018-08-02 20:13:28	@deww	your call. it's cheaper than replacing a whole laptop
2018-08-02 20:13:40	@deww	the cost of the laptop has no bearings wit hthe battery

2018-08-03 00:44:42	myxenovia	all solution i see is format
2018-08-03 00:44:51	myxenovia	but i have important files 
2018-08-03 00:45:51	@PipeItToDevNull	You cant 
2018-08-03 00:46:05	@PipeItToDevNull	That is a last ditch step the firmware takes to protects its data 
2018-08-03 00:46:11	@PipeItToDevNull	Also, That is a fucking horrible idea 
2018-08-03 00:46:32	myxenovia	so i wont be able to write it anymore?
2018-08-03 00:46:36	@PipeItToDevNull	flash storage is at best ephemeral and should NEVER be trusted for storage 
2018-08-03 00:46:39	@PipeItToDevNull	No,you wont 
2018-08-03 00:46:56	myxenovia	what should i do i need my flash drive
2018-08-03 00:47:07	myxenovia	idont know why it happens
2018-08-03 00:47:20	@PipeItToDevNull	it is cheap flash storage
2018-08-03 00:47:22	@PipeItToDevNull	It fails 
2018-08-03 00:47:29	myxenovia	lol
2018-08-03 00:47:31	@PipeItToDevNull	That write lock is the protection mechanism 
2018-08-03 00:47:54	myxenovia	so the only way is to format it and lose all my files?
2018-08-03 00:47:54	@PipeItToDevNull	They are not made to be long term storage devices and should never be used as such 
2018-08-03 00:47:59	@PipeItToDevNull	No, it is dead 
2018-08-03 00:48:04	@PipeItToDevNull	You cannot remove a write lock 
2018-08-03 00:48:19	myxenovia	but why is there successful solution in internet. 
2018-08-03 00:48:23	myxenovia	like formatting
2018-08-03 00:48:27	@PipeItToDevNull	It wont be 
2018-08-03 00:48:27	myxenovia	i havent tried because i dont want to format

2018-08-03 08:37:15	GPUorMonitor	Hey, I'm having some difficulties with my new build. The graphics just aren't what I was expecting (went from a GTX 970 in my old build to a RX 580 8G) - even simple things like high resolution images don't look great. 3D mark and other benchmarks I've run come back with good results, but they look awful while I'm running them. I never ran them on 
2018-08-03 08:37:15	GPUorMonitor	my old PC though, so I can't compare. Short of swapping out GPUs and monitors, which I don't have spares for, how can I determine if the bad quality images are due to my monitor or GPU?
2018-08-03 08:38:58	GPUorMonitor	I ran the Unreal 4 Elemental demo too, didn't look that great, but marginally better than the 3D mark stuff.
2018-08-03 08:39:36	GPUorMonitor	Also ran Stalker Clear Skies, but that was a stuttering, unusable mess, though that might be down to the benchmark itself from what I've heard.

2018-08-03 11:49:04	n0k0m	Hello! I ran into a bugging issue. I have a Gigabyte GA-B75M-D3V motherboard with an i5 3550 and i upgraded to a i7 3770 (it is on the supported cpu list). The PC booted, but it used the integrated graphics instead of the dedicated vga. I manually disabled the integrated/set PCI-e to priority/set PCI-e to gen 1-2, but whenever it tries to boot with
2018-08-03 11:49:04	n0k0m	 the dedicated card the fans start and stops right after, the pc restart itself and it beeps. I tried out 2 different cards. I changed to the integrated to update the bios but it didn't help either. I reinstalled the 3550 and everything works fine. So the i7 is working but it doesn't control the PCI-e. (nothing shows up in device manager either). A
2018-08-03 11:49:04	n0k0m	ny idea?
2018-08-03 11:50:33	@Mandevwin	did you have the display cable plugged into the motherboard?

2018-08-03 18:32:22	@PipeItToDevNull	I would look into the nvidia settings panel 
2018-08-03 18:35:40	Cypher-Punk	This might be a dumb question, but I'm doing a slow format on my brand new external HDDs. They started at ~30 megabytes per second, and after a couple hours they slowed to 8-9 megabytes per second and has been fluctuating between 8 and 9 ever since. I started over on it before and the same thing happened.
2018-08-03 18:35:55	Cypher-Punk	Oh, the question: Why is it doing this?
2018-08-03 18:37:39	cancamcan	Played with the resolutions and manual adjust in the monitor. Got it down to about half an inch off-centered.
2018-08-03 18:37:43	@PipeItToDevNull	Cause what you are doing is stupid 
2018-08-03 18:37:51	@PipeItToDevNull	There is no reason to overwrite a new disk 
2018-08-03 18:38:59	Cypher-Punk	PipeItToDevNull: Well I needed to format it from exFAT to NTFS anyway, so I figured the slow format would find any problems that it came with.
2018-08-03 18:39:32	@PipeItToDevNull	That is what SMART is for 
2018-08-03 18:41:06	Cypher-Punk	PipeItToDevNull: Does SMART deal with bad sectors?
2018-08-03 18:41:43	@PipeItToDevNull	Nothing "deals with" bad sectors, it knows when they exist and if they are mitigated 
2018-08-03 18:42:12	Cypher-Punk	By "deal with" I meant mark them so it knows not to write data on them.
2018-08-03 18:42:30	@PipeItToDevNull	That is what the firmware does 
2018-08-03 18:43:03	Cypher-Punk	So the chkdsk feature to check sectors is obsolete and useless now?
2018-08-03 18:43:44	@PipeItToDevNull	That is a function of the NTFS 
2018-08-03 18:43:53	@PipeItToDevNull	It checks the NTFS for errors and corrects them 
2018-08-03 18:44:06	@PipeItToDevNull	Also, firmware has always been the thing that deals with the sectors 
2018-08-03 18:45:31	Cypher-Punk	chkdsk doesn't only repair the file system, it has an option to check for an mark bad sectors as well iirc.
2018-08-03 18:45:37	Cypher-Punk	for and*
2018-08-03 18:46:06	@PipeItToDevNull	Kind of
2018-08-03 18:47:33	Cypher-Punk	I assumed slow formatting would make the drive detect any bad sectors. I was trying to go for a two-birds-one-stone thing. Maybe it's just a waste of time and I should cancel and quick format.
2018-08-03 18:47:36	Cypher-Punk	It has 8 days to go.

2018-08-03 20:16:12	Cypher-Punk	I use both Windows 10 and Linux Mint. If I encrypt an entire external drive as opposed to just a partition, will veracrypt in Windows even be able to detect it to mount it like I can in Mint?
2018-08-03 20:16:43	Cypher-Punk	Because iirc, Veracrypt can only see drives with assigned letters in Windows, but Mint it doesn't need to see partitions at all to mount.

2018-08-03 20:27:38	dunnousernamefn	I could lshw or something
2018-08-03 20:27:44	dunnousernamefn	should I just run a smart test?
2018-08-03 20:28:05	@whitewolf	dunnousernamefn: i'd start with a smart test then if there's nothing obvious, grab something like open hardware monitor and make sure all your fans and voltages are good
2018-08-03 20:28:21	@whitewolf	asdhe: an obvious test would be to remove your router and test one of your machines directly behind the modem
2018-08-03 20:28:39	asdhe	whitewolf: there's no modem. Its a fiber connection
2018-08-03 20:28:41	Captainbirdfox	i havent been, all i do is play monster hunter and my ps4 has been in rest mode for the past week just updating itself. I have changed the mac address before biut i followed a video on how to do it awhile ago and can not find that video, could anyone be able to help me?
2018-08-03 20:28:54	@whitewolf	asdhe: OK, so test a PC straight into the ONT
2018-08-03 20:29:11	@whitewolf	asdhe: and let me know which router you're using behind it
2018-08-03 20:29:43	@whitewolf	Captainbirdfox: google your router + spoof mac address, i'm sure you'll find a guide

2018-08-03 20:45:19	@whitewolf	you're going to have to go through the settings and make sure the ipv6 settings are all enabled
2018-08-03 20:45:36	@whitewolf	if you do that and you're still having trouble my intution would be to put custom firmware on it or get a newer router, preferably one that doesn't use a broadcom chipset

2018-08-05 17:51:15	HelloThere	I have actually been wanting to do it, just haven't had the time. Because the computer is already so slow, it makes it really hard to do any file transfer.
2018-08-05 17:51:21	@Mikeee	data loss is 100% a user fault.
2018-08-05 17:51:24	HelloThere	Yes, it's my dad's computer.

2018-08-05 17:52:29	HelloThere	Honestly though, I didn't even think hard drive failure was the reason his computer was being sluggish. I assumed it was mainly the lack of ram that was causing it.
2018-08-05 17:54:22	@electricbear	well you've been helped. if you can put a new drive into the device, do that and put OS X on the new drive. then boot that way and use an adapter to get files off the old drive

2018-08-05 17:57:17	HelloThere	Once this hd thing is settled, I'm gonna try and convince him to just buy a new pc. I think it would be less of a hassle.
2018-08-05 17:57:38	@electricbear	you can throw a cheap ssd into it

2018-08-05 21:08:27	webvictim	i mean, i doubt CSGO stresses it enough to really make it overheat but i have a friend who has a similar problem, his monitor will switch off randomly when he's gaming and the way he fixed it was just to get more ventilation into his case
2018-08-05 21:09:38	webvictim	another thing would be to try a lower refresh rate like 120Hz and see whether the issue persists
2018-08-05 21:16:50	pin	Interesting. Definitely not the graphics card because I had a 144hz I was using just before this one that frustrated me to no end and was a piece of shit so I got this one to replace it, but it never happened with that one. Problem just appeared when I bought the benq
2018-08-05 21:17:20	pin	And it has also happened when I dont have any game open
2018-08-05 21:18:53	pin	But the overheating of the monitor? an interesting theory tbh. I dont know enough about monitors to know about how the heating/ventilation works. Do monitors get more warm when you game? Never really thought about that
2018-08-05 21:19:07	pin	Suppose its possible
2018-08-05 21:24:31	webvictim	nah, i was talking about the graphics card. monitors do heat up but it shouldn’t be a huge problem
2018-08-05 21:24:43	webvictim	it’s more likely that there’s some kind of intermittent fault with the monitor maybe
2018-08-05 21:24:58	webvictim	hopefully benq have a process for it
2018-08-05 21:25:10	pin	Ah ok. Yeah hopefully.

2018-08-05 22:01:07	webvictim	you probably made it in UEFI mode but you’d likely need to use BIOS mode for a computer that old
2018-08-05 22:01:12	webvictim	there’s a checkbox in rufus
2018-08-05 22:01:23	@PipeItToDevNull	IIRC efi is default 
2018-08-05 22:01:27	webvictim	it is

2018-08-05 22:02:29	webvictim	good luck
2018-08-05 22:03:10	ThatBroadcasterG	Is that the add fixes for old Bioses option?

2018-08-05 22:06:15	daddymcnugget	i bought an inland professional SSD to put my OS on. i copied my HHD to the SSD using Acronis. it seemed to work. when i tried to boot off my SSD it says unkown hard error.i checked the events of the ssd and it says its not migrated.
2018-08-05 22:07:06	@PipeItToDevNull	Install to the SSD fresh and wipe the HDD then structure it to hold data properly 
2018-08-05 22:08:52	daddymcnugget	ok so i should wipe the ssd too before i fresh install my os to it?
2018-08-05 22:09:23	@PipeItToDevNull	boot the installer, remove its partitions, select the empty space to install to 
2018-08-05 22:13:38	daddymcnugget	ok thank you so much

2018-08-05 22:19:20	@PipeItToDevNull	So reinstall your OS completely 
2018-08-05 22:19:33	@PipeItToDevNull	You cannot move CPU and MOBO
2018-08-05 22:20:06	thecrytpokeeper	It worked because they are both Acer. The problem happened when I then uninstalled CCC.
2018-08-05 22:20:21	@PipeItToDevNull	that isnt how it works

2018-08-05 22:23:40	LymeMN	What are considered safe temps for a 3 year old CPU on a stock cooler? lol
2018-08-05 22:24:00	@Mikeee	that isn't a valid question
2018-08-05 22:24:29	@Mikeee	Temperature limits vary by processor
2018-08-05 22:25:26	LymeMN	AMD 8350 8Core
2018-08-05 22:27:10	@PipeItToDevNull	less than 70c
2018-08-05 22:27:29	@Mikeee	any higher than 62 is a problem
2018-08-05 22:27:42	LymeMN	Ah, well ive had very consistant crashing issues as of late and have been replacing things left n right trying to fix it.
2018-08-05 22:27:53	@PipeItToDevNull	What is your temp
2018-08-05 22:27:55	LymeMN	and this may be the culprit, as it idles at 55-75
2018-08-05 22:27:56	@electricbear	actual cpu temp shouldnt be higher than 62
2018-08-05 22:28:02	@electricbear	the socket temp can be 70+
2018-08-05 22:28:07	@Mikeee	then repaste and clean the heatsink
2018-08-05 22:28:09	LymeMN	while gaming it goes to 80-85.
2018-08-05 22:28:11	@electricbear	(i have an 8350)
2018-08-05 22:28:20	@PipeItToDevNull	I have an 8350 as well 
2018-08-05 22:28:27	@electricbear	;D;D
2018-08-05 22:28:41	@electricbear	LymeMN, that's way too high
2018-08-05 22:28:53	LymeMN	Okay, so that may be the issue with my crashing then.
2018-08-05 22:29:01	@electricbear	get a better cooler, repaste it
2018-08-05 22:29:08	@electricbear	or a better CPU 
2018-08-05 22:29:19	@PipeItToDevNull	meh, better CPU means a new PC 
2018-08-05 22:29:20	LymeMN	there is no better cpu for this mobo really.
2018-08-05 22:29:26	LymeMN	^ exxaclty

2018-08-05 22:29:39	@electricbear	I'm about to get a new one tho
2018-08-05 22:30:02	LymeMN	i been trying to find a fan for it ive bought 2 that say they are the right type and get to me and need to be screwed in
2018-08-05 22:30:07	LymeMN	the stock fan is just a clip on.
2018-08-05 22:30:14	@PipeItToDevNull	I use an AIO 
2018-08-05 22:30:32	@PipeItToDevNull	46c right now 
2018-08-05 22:30:40	@PipeItToDevNull	nm, 32
2018-08-05 22:30:58	@Mikeee	stock coolers are more than enough, but you have to keep them clean and refresh paste when needed
2018-08-05 22:31:14	@PipeItToDevNull	As long as they are at base clock 
2018-08-05 22:31:17	@Mikeee	if you're dumb enough to overclock, you'll need better though
2018-08-05 22:32:22	Truffles	So I don't mean to interrupt, but I still am having a problem with my desktop functioning fine physically but will not display anything
2018-08-05 22:32:38	@Mikeee	physically?
2018-08-05 22:32:42	@Mikeee	you mean it isn't on fire?
2018-08-05 22:32:42	Truffles	and in reference to earlier I checked and my msi mobo does not a speaker
2018-08-05 22:33:03	@PipeItToDevNull	You need a speaker, or parts, to continue troubleshooting 
2018-08-05 22:33:05	Truffles	everything runs normally. the fans, hard drive, cpu fan, and gpu all run
2018-08-05 22:33:09	@PipeItToDevNull	Your fans spin, and that is all we know 
2018-08-05 22:33:22	Truffles	would any desktop speaker work?
2018-08-05 22:33:27	@PipeItToDevNull	The GPU does not run as far as we know 
2018-08-05 22:33:31	@PipeItToDevNull	No, the mobo speaker 
2018-08-05 22:33:32	@Mikeee	yeah basically everything you stated just means the 12v rail is active
2018-08-05 22:33:35	@Mikeee	nothing else
2018-08-05 22:33:41	@Mikeee	I'd say breadboard it

2018-08-05 22:34:21	LymeMN	Would an overheating CPU cause constant freezes while gaming n such? ive spent 300 bucks trying to fix this issue and if it would have been solved with some new thermal paste... lol
2018-08-05 22:34:30	@PipeItToDevNull	LymeMN, yes 
2018-08-05 22:34:32	@Mikeee	yes
2018-08-05 22:34:38	@PipeItToDevNull	It SHOULD cause that

2018-08-05 22:35:51	@Mikeee	it is possible that your neglect has caused damage to the processor, though
2018-08-05 22:35:58	Truffles	my mobo is H81M-P33 so it's pretty basic. I breadboarded it this morning and had issues from step one. Would taking out the CPU and cleaning help?
2018-08-05 22:36:01	@Mikeee	so maybe new paste can solve it, maybe not

The audio distorts for the time of the freeze, first is distorts in my headset then starts playing from the monitor speaker (that i dont normally use) then back to the headset when it recovers. It recovers about 90% of the time the other 10% i have to reboot.
2018-08-06 06:05:35	silent132	Nothing comes up in event viewer that is notable. Also i've tried removing overclock (asus preset) and disabling XMP. The problem still persists. I have no idea where to start with this problem, i have not the slightest lead on what it could be. Hardware? Software? OS?

Idk if this is the same server i was asking questions on earlier today, as im logged into a different cpu. Anyway, I seem to be having trouble finding a NVMe pci adapter to use with the 960. Everything seems to only be compatible with SATA

2018-08-06 21:49:39	Sea-Bot	nick/Mikeee would that be from Install disc, or download on another computer?
2018-08-06 21:49:58	@electricbear	WetSponge, "Hey see this drive containing the Master Boot Record and all required boot files? I'm going to wipe it"
2018-08-06 21:50:01	@Mikeee	download from the manufacturers website, transfer to computer.
2018-08-06 21:50:07	@electricbear	what exactly did you wipe?
2018-08-06 21:50:13	Sea-Bot	Thanks
2018-08-06 21:50:36	livinin82	Anyone?
2018-08-06 21:51:46	WetSponge	electricbear: I was running off a liveboot on my external drive (when it worked) and wiped the /dev/somethingorother drive that it explicitly warned me not to wipe, and I believe I removed the filesystem but didn't reformat it
2018-08-06 21:52:07	--	livinin82 is now known as Napoleon
2018-08-06 21:52:20	WetSponge	electricbear:  It was the one containing the Ubuntu distro I currently had on it, the 64gb inbuilt drive in my notebook

2018-08-06 21:54:32	WetSponge	Oh, forgot to mention it's UEFI NOT CMS BIOS
2018-08-06 21:54:40	WetSponge	Should probably have stated that
2018-08-06 21:55:06	@electricbear	your HDD should still be detected
2018-08-06 21:55:14	@electricbear	can you check the connections

2018-08-06 21:58:05	Cypher-Punk	I'm upsetti. Now I want spaghetti. My file transfer did awesome for the first 85%, then dropped to 1 megabyte or less per second. What do?
2018-08-06 21:58:20	@electricbear	Sea-Bot, just search for Device Manager in the start menu
2018-08-06 21:58:28	WetSponge	electricbear: They seem to be fine, no fried connections or anything like that, seems normal

2018-08-06 21:58:46	AlexSinco	ARedditor im not one of the tech guys here, but I just started having problems with the same router yesterday
2018-08-06 21:58:53	@electricbear	WetSponge, you have a bizarre issue
2018-08-06 21:59:04	WetSponge	electricbear: I'm stumped at the fact that it literally happened suddenly, as beforehand it was working fine
2018-08-06 21:59:19	@Mikeee	thats a weird thing to be stumped about
2018-08-06 21:59:29	@Mikeee	as things don't often slowly fail, but all at once
2018-08-06 21:59:40	ARedditor	@AlexSinco do you have charter?
2018-08-06 21:59:51	AlexSinco	charter?

2018-08-06 22:00:02	AlexSinco	no
2018-08-06 22:00:07	AlexSinco	optimum
2018-08-06 22:00:16	WetSponge	Mikeee: yes, but this is a brand new drive, brand new enclosure, a laptop that';s been used like 5-6 times and the only thing that I've done is wiped it
2018-08-06 22:00:17	AlexSinco	the wifi in my house is fine
2018-08-06 22:00:33	@Mikeee	WetSponge:  brand new things have the highest failure rate
2018-08-06 22:00:40	AlexSinco	i connected to ethernet and it works perfectly
2018-08-06 22:00:56	WetSponge	Mikeee: But the thing is, both the drive and enclosure work on my main PC
2018-08-06 22:00:58	AlexSinco	but on wifi, im getting <1Mb/sec
2018-08-06 22:01:14	WetSponge	Mikeee: and the laptop runs fine, all the connectors are fine and everything
2018-08-06 22:01:18	@Mikeee	WetSponge:  I was only correcting your logical fallacies.
2018-08-06 22:01:28	@Mikeee	so you can focus on real things.
2018-08-06 22:01:31	WetSponge	Mikeee: fair enough
2018-08-06 22:01:35	AlexSinco	I don't have a solution yet ARedditor, maybe theyll release an update
2018-08-06 22:02:09	WetSponge	electricbear: Don't suppose the format of the drive would prevent it from being detected? as in MBR/GPT?
2018-08-06 22:02:26	ARedditor	my wifi is the same issue
2018-08-06 22:02:36	ARedditor	<1Mb/sec
2018-08-06 22:02:42	Napoleon	I have a 256gb m.Sata drive that only shows half capacity. This is in disk manager, linux, and mac, full 256gb is shown in BIOS
2018-08-06 22:02:44	ARedditor	Was hoping I could find a solution here
2018-08-06 22:02:58	@electricbear	WetSponge, wouldnt explain why you cant boot other stuff
2018-08-06 22:03:22	@electricbear	try a flash drive with UEFI 
2018-08-06 22:03:29	WetSponge	GPT?
2018-08-06 22:03:42	@electricbear	same thing
2018-08-06 22:03:53	WetSponge	ye
2018-08-06 22:04:25	WetSponge	Could try booting FreeDOS?
2018-08-06 22:04:37	Cypher-Punk	What could make a massive file transfer's speed absolutely nosedive? The file sizes are fairly consistent.

2018-08-06 22:08:47	WetSponge	Bad sector maybe? I don't know how that would show up with window's no doubt faulty graphics

2018-08-06 22:53:10	Howdy_McGee	Ima assume the list is options that are already available on the laptop and choose Pro N

2018-08-06 22:57:44	Howdy_McGee	I have 6 different partitions on this for some reason. Could I in theory delete them all with the exception of Primary and use that to install Windows?

2018-08-06 22:58:46	@Swede	yes. you'll lose win8 restore, but that's the plan I think
2018-08-06 22:58:53	Cypher-Punk	I believe windows 10 would repartition it all to suit its needs anyway, but I've never done it.

2018-08-06 23:18:36	AMissingSock	Any suggestions for a slow router problem? Checked a couple of websites to see the speed and it's coming out to less than 1Mbps. It was working fine earlier but then all my devices stopped connecting and I begin reseting the router
2018-08-06 23:18:49	Cypher-Punk	MiracleDonut Fire away, someone will help eventually, but I'm not sure I'll be much help on this topic.
2018-08-06 23:23:43	MiracleDonut	So I got a Gigabyte G1 Gaming GTX 1080 after a whole ordeal with an RMA involving them sending back a broken 980ti. They sent back a 1080 which I was fine with, but after doing a fresh install of the driver software and restarting my computer I've literally been unable to break 60fps in Overwatch on Low. So I went into HW Monitor and got a friend t
2018-08-06 23:23:43	MiracleDonut	o show me his utilization numbers, and the only thing differnet is the Powers percentage which showed his hitting 76% while mine hits 29% max. I've tried reseating the GPU, i've tried reseating in a different PCI slot, i've tried older drivers, i've tried a 2nd fresh install of new drivers, i've tried changing the power settings to max performance,
2018-08-06 23:23:43	MiracleDonut	 and I even installed the stupid gigabyte AORUS software. I still can't break 55fps average on lowest settings and i'm worried the card they sent me is a used/broken card.

2018-08-07 03:58:33	@Eisenstein	I decided a good solution was to take my old iphone 5S which has a broken mic and thus is useless as a phone, and turn it into an ipod
2018-08-07 03:59:05	@Eisenstein	it had iOS 9,whatever on it and itunes does not like old iOS's
2018-08-07 03:59:24	@Eisenstein	it would not sync my music. it said it did but it didnt
2018-08-07 03:59:52	@Eisenstein	I got the iOS 12 beta and manually pushed it onto the 5S
2018-08-07 04:00:20	@Eisenstein	suprisingly, it didnt croak and now works great as a 64gb music/podcast player
2018-08-07 04:00:36	@Eisenstein	the end
2018-08-07 04:02:32	@Eisenstein	btw I hate apple but I get free iphones from people who decide they need to upgrade to the new one every generation.  I am one or two generations behind everyone else but free is very much better than money
2018-08-07 04:03:15	@Eisenstein	even if itunes was (my theory - allegedly, dont sue me) designed purposefully to suck ass on windows so that people would but macs
2018-08-07 04:04:47	@Eisenstein	I have a very vivid scenario in my head of seeing steve jobs yell at some coder in a basement to make itunes windows port more useless because people are buying ipods but they can use them on windows
2018-08-07 04:04:58	@Eisenstein	this would be around 2003-2006
2018-08-07 04:05:12	@Eisenstein	when they had to change from firewire to USB on the ipod
2018-08-07 04:06:20	@Eisenstein	stevey boy said 'hey is it possible we could make the usb version randomly just like, make things not work, but not in obvious ways, just in ways that piss people off
2018-08-07 04:07:12	@Eisenstein	and generic project manager said 'of course steve! please dont eat my children and also can you shower once in a while?'
2018-08-07 04:07:45	@Eisenstein	and then steve said 'I am a vegan I dont eat children and also that is why I dont need to shower'
2018-08-07 04:07:55	@Eisenstein	and then he fired the guy 
2018-08-07 04:08:00	@Eisenstein	in an elevator
2018-08-07 04:08:45	@Eisenstein	come on guys, this is a totally plausible story.  have you read anything about this guy?
2018-08-07 04:10:34	@Eisenstein	guess I am talking to myself.  I am going to watch black hawk down because it is funny how 100,000 people with automatic weapons only managed to kill like 3 guys out of 100 who invaded their city

2018-08-07 04:11:52	@Eisenstein	is that supposed to be some sort of arguement?
2018-08-07 04:14:47	@Eisenstein	apparently that is on the logical fallacy list
2018-08-07 04:14:50	@Eisenstein	The Complex Question: The contemporary fallacy of demanding a direct answer to a question that cannot be answered without first analyzing or challenging the basis of the question itself. E.g., "Just answer me 'yes' or 'no':  Did you think you could get away with plagiarism and not suffer the consequences?" Or, "Why did you rob that bank?" Also applies to situations where one is forced to either accept or reject complex standpoints
2018-08-07 04:14:50	@Eisenstein	 or propositions containing both acceptable and unacceptable parts. A corruption of the argument from logos. A counterpart of Either/Or Reasoning.

2018-08-07 04:17:54	Crazedtech	Bluetooth Dongle's Hardware ID seems a bit weird and i was wondering if it is translatable
2018-08-07 04:18:35	Crazedtech	It looks like this {473a6b1d-3407-400e-b91a-f991c5a39dc3}\CsrBtPort
2018-08-07 04:19:53	@Eisenstein	Crazedtech: it is translatable is you are the driver
2018-08-07 04:19:57	@Eisenstein	if*
2018-08-07 04:20:15	Crazedtech	?
2018-08-07 04:20:20	@Eisenstein	its a hex number that is unique to a hardware ID
2018-08-07 04:20:33	Crazedtech	Oh
2018-08-07 04:20:44	@Eisenstein	hex is base 16
2018-08-07 04:20:50	Crazedtech	I need to translate it to one of the Hardware IDs that starts with USB
2018-08-07 04:20:53	@Eisenstein	the go from 0 to f
2018-08-07 04:21:06	@Eisenstein	insteat of 0 to 9
2018-08-07 04:21:23	@Eisenstein	0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f
2018-08-07 04:21:25	Crazedtech	How would i translate it then?
2018-08-07 04:21:32	@Eisenstein	it is just a number
2018-08-07 04:21:38	Crazedtech	It's got too many digits.
2018-08-07 04:21:48	Crazedtech	Not enough to match a normal Hardware ID
2018-08-07 04:21:48	@Eisenstein	it is not base 10
2018-08-07 04:22:06	Crazedtech	It needs to look something like this
2018-08-07 04:22:07	@Eisenstein	sorry I dont know how many digits hardare ids use
2018-08-07 04:22:07	Crazedtech	USB\VID_044E&PID_300D
2018-08-07 04:22:48	@Eisenstein	usb uses the hub principle
2018-08-07 04:23:10	@Eisenstein	it makes a controller (hub) talk to the devices
2018-08-07 04:23:27	@Eisenstein	so the USB id on the OS could bbe different from the hardware ID on the device
2018-08-07 04:23:43	@Eisenstein	honestly what is your problem?
2018-08-07 04:23:46	Crazedtech	I just need to get the Hardware ID of the Bluetooth dongle.
2018-08-07 04:23:53	@Eisenstein	as in, why?

2018-08-07 04:24:07	@Eisenstein	why do you care?
2018-08-07 04:24:16	Crazedtech	So i can use it on the Toshiba Stack.
2018-08-07 04:24:24	Crazedtech	The default software is poorly made
2018-08-07 04:24:28	Crazedtech	So i'm changing it
2018-08-07 04:24:49	@Eisenstein	what is a toshiba stack>
2018-08-07 04:24:56	Crazedtech	A Bluetooth driver.
2018-08-07 04:25:10	Crazedtech	That only works with Toshiba devices unless you edit in the Hardware ID
2018-08-07 04:25:16	@Eisenstein	you are trying to install a driver for a device not meant for that device
2018-08-07 04:25:27	Crazedtech	Except it is possible.
2018-08-07 04:25:40	Crazedtech	It just needs the Hardware ID to pick up the wireless dongle.
2018-08-07 04:25:42	@Eisenstein	possible does not mean certain
2018-08-07 04:25:54	Crazedtech	It's doable.
2018-08-07 04:26:13	Crazedtech	It's one of the main ways to connect a Wiimote to a PC with a bluetooth dongle.
2018-08-07 04:26:32	Crazedtech	If the problem isn't sortable, i'll just ask elsewhere.
2018-08-07 04:26:36	@Eisenstein	you got a cheapo knock off dongle with some kind of mass produced chinese shady bluetooth to usb bridge chipset
2018-08-07 04:26:47	Crazedtech	CSR.
2018-08-07 04:27:03	Crazedtech	We've gone completely off my question so i assume you can't help me
2018-08-07 04:27:04	@Eisenstein	I would love to help but I guess this is out of my wheelhouse
2018-08-07 04:27:13	Crazedtech	Okay. that's fine.
2018-08-07 04:27:20	@Eisenstein	sorry
2018-08-07 04:27:30	Crazedtech	It's ok, i'll just carry on searching

2018-08-07 16:56:50	@Mandevwin	Korey, find these three entries and delete them. note that there are similar entries. do not delete the ones that end in E, only the ones that end in F
2018-08-07 16:57:08	@Mandevwin	Cypher-Punk, id probably format the drive o0r run a chkdsk on it
2018-08-07 16:57:51	Korey	Which three?
2018-08-07 16:58:18	@Mandevwin	Korey, "Courier 10,12,15 (120)" , "MS Sans Serif 8,10,12,14,18,24 (120)" , and "MS Serif 8,10,12,14,18,24 (120)"
2018-08-07 16:58:26	Cypher-Punk	I ran a chkdsk /R after it. It said windows has made corrections to the filesystem. Perhaps it's fine now. I'll give it another test run after my Seagate chkdsk is done.
2018-08-07 16:58:30	@Mandevwin	only remove the ones that have the 120 at the end

2018-08-07 17:04:58	@Mandevwin	i would, then just remove them again if it does

2018-08-08 00:26:36	eseeten	Hey there, laptop randomly started taking 30+ minutes on "starting windows" screen and booting and has barely functioned after getting past that. Booting in safe mode does nothing and Ive tried removing each of the ram sticks individually. Inclined to believe its a hardware issue but not quite sure the best way to diagnose from here

2018-08-08 01:33:40	eseeten	Thanks guys looks like the hdd has an abnormally high pending sector count and had no luck with attempting normal disk repair. Anything that might fix the drive while wiping it or should I just pick up a new one?

2018-08-08 03:31:03	Archy	So my 360 total security says that I need to update 3 of my drivers, but I kinda suck at finding the updates through the vendor websites. I'd like to know where exactly I can find the required updates.
2018-08-08 03:39:37	deswin	Archy: You're looking for newer versions, correct?
2018-08-08 03:40:12	Archy	Yes.
2018-08-08 03:40:31	Archy	I think I've found a way to update my graphic card, but I am still not sure about the sound and motherboard drivers.
2018-08-08 03:40:35	deswin	Your manufacturer keeps things held back for specific products because they are tested and confirmed working
2018-08-08 03:40:56	deswin	newer stuff isn't tested, therefor confirmed safe to install
2018-08-08 03:41:27	deswin	so you keep it simple, and don't worry about newer versions. The website for your board is the way to go, and whatever else.
2018-08-08 03:41:56	Archy	The thing is that I use AMD motherboard, but for some reason it says that I am using an unsupported version even thought I bought it from them.
2018-08-08 03:42:13	deswin	an AMD motherboard?
2018-08-08 03:42:30	Archy	I feel like updating the drivers would be a good idea cause right now my computer takes 15+ minutes to start up.
2018-08-08 03:42:50	deswin	There's a bigger issue then
2018-08-08 03:42:57	deswin	and drivers I don't believe will fix that
2018-08-08 03:43:06	Archy	Yeah, I guess it's more of the hard drive problem
2018-08-08 03:43:28	deswin	either your OS is bogged, you're overheating, or one or more drives are failing
2018-08-08 03:43:57	Archy	But the issue with that is that - my friend built this pc for me, and I am not so good at building pc myself, so I'm not sure what hard drive would fit my pc.
2018-08-08 03:44:25	deswin	does your main drive make noises?
2018-08-08 03:44:58	Archy	What sort of noise?
2018-08-08 03:45:06	Archy	The only noise I hear are my fans lol
2018-08-08 03:45:10	deswin	if it does, it should be an HDD, you should instead buy a SSD 
2018-08-08 03:45:34	deswin	if the OS install is fresh, you should consider an SSD
2018-08-08 03:45:38	Archy	There are no noises that should feel concerning
2018-08-08 03:45:41	Archy	Hmm..
2018-08-08 03:45:49	Archy	SSD was the hard drive that can be carried around, right?
2018-08-08 03:46:26	deswin	No, not unless you mean a "passport" which can be an SSD. We call them external storage
2018-08-08 03:46:49	deswin	passport = (basically) external storage
2018-08-08 03:46:55	Archy	Oh ok I got it now. Why do u suggest SSD?
2018-08-08 03:47:09	deswin	Because they're much faster than a regular HDD
2018-08-08 03:47:29	deswin	and produce nice results you'll be like "did I just get a new computer wtf why is everything instant now"
2018-08-08 03:47:50	Archy	Hmm.
2018-08-08 03:47:55	Archy	Okay, I'll keep this in mind tbh
2018-08-08 03:48:09	deswin	im still not sure if it's hardware unless you did do a CLEAN FRESH reinstall 
2018-08-08 03:48:09	Archy	I'll probably order a SSD then
2018-08-08 03:48:18	Archy	No, I haven't done a fresh reinstall
2018-08-08 03:48:26	deswin	then that's your next task
2018-08-08 03:48:28	Archy	I have a few games on my computer that I want to finish before I do a reinstall lol
2018-08-08 03:48:34	deswin	unless, well, you just want an SSD anyway
2018-08-08 03:48:35	Archy	Don't want to lose my progress
2018-08-08 03:48:45	deswin	because you'll be happy  with your purchase if you buy an SSD
2018-08-08 03:48:54	Archy	I will keep that in mind. But where should I even hold that SSD?
2018-08-08 03:49:04	Archy	AFAIK you can't just put it in your pc like HDD?
2018-08-08 03:49:42	deswin	you can, just like a HDD, only SSD are smaller, wont matter as your case will likely be able to mount it anywhere, even along with your HDD
2018-08-08 03:50:07	Archy	Hmm.
2018-08-08 03:50:15	deswin	so you'll have an SSD reserved for your OS's essentials
2018-08-08 03:50:16	Archy	I think I've seen a SSD with my own eyes only once
2018-08-08 03:50:30	Archy	And they used a cable to connect the SSD to the pc
2018-08-08 03:50:32	deswin	and an HDD for storage, (games, movies, porn, etc)
2018-08-08 03:50:48	Archy	So when I get SSD, I'd have to carry all the OS files to the SSD?
2018-08-08 03:51:01	deswin	no, you install fresh from a flash drive
2018-08-08 03:51:05	deswin	usb flash drive
2018-08-08 03:51:07	deswin	?win10
2018-08-08 03:51:07	@TechSupport	Use Microsoft's Media Creation Tool and select your bootable device (USB or burnable DVD) to install windows 10 from - https://goo.gl/Wn3duz
2018-08-08 03:51:23	Archy	Oh
2018-08-08 03:51:31	Archy	Basically do a new reinstall and put the OS files in the SSD?
2018-08-08 03:51:36	Archy	i mean there's an option to do so i think
2018-08-08 03:52:18	deswin	you dont drag anything from your HDD to the SSD, a fresh install has everything needed in what Microsoft's Media Creation Tool creates
2018-08-08 03:52:38	Archy	Since I have never experienced what you're talking about, it can be normal that I'm a bit confused now
2018-08-08 03:53:05	deswin	its very simple once you do it.
2018-08-08 03:53:07	Archy	Let me check that link out
2018-08-08 03:53:14	deswin	Microsoft's Media Creation Tool will do most of the dirty work

2018-08-08 03:53:35	Archy	is it already in the windows10 installation files, or do i have to get it?
2018-08-08 03:53:56	deswin	Microsoft's Media Creation Tool will be your "installer buddy" to freshly install the OS onto the new SSD
2018-08-08 03:54:36	Archy	Eh, I am a bit confused on how does the media creation tool work.
2018-08-08 03:54:46	Archy	Do I have to do a fresh install of windows 10 when I want to install the OS into the SSD?
2018-08-08 03:55:02	Archy	Or can I do that without reinstalling the entire windows 10?
2018-08-08 03:55:24	deswin	so you take a USB flash drive, plug it into the PC, open Microsoft's Media Creation Tool, create media, boot into it, then select your new SSD, and click next a few times
2018-08-08 03:55:37	deswin	it'll go by so fast you wont know what hit you
2018-08-08 03:56:48	Archy	So I have to get the creation tool into the USB?
2018-08-08 03:56:57	Archy	I should probably get it before i ask these questions
2018-08-08 03:57:03	Archy	as I have no idea how does the creation tool even work.
2018-08-08 03:57:14	Archy	But thanks, I'll keep that in mind when I get SSD. Could possibly help a lot.

2018-08-08 17:19:01	@Mandevwin	did you run the uninstaller for winzip? that would have deleted the registry entries for it. 
2018-08-08 17:19:11	ccccccc	Yeah I pretty much destroyed it
2018-08-08 17:19:14	ccccccc	can't remember how now
2018-08-08 17:19:25	ccccccc	I just assumed it was a part of what I downloaded and didn't need it
2018-08-08 17:19:30	CoJaBo	Is there any way to run a command that will reliably result in changing the mouse cursor? I'm trying to fix the "mouse cursor gets set to invisible after standby" bug, and this appears to be the only way to fix it (open to less-insane suggestions tho ofc).
2018-08-08 17:19:32	ccccccc	Just because a new desktop shortcut was created
2018-08-08 17:19:35	@Mandevwin	the proper way to uninstall a program is to run the uninstaller. are you saying this is now what you did?
2018-08-08 17:19:37	CoJaBo	(OS is Linux)
2018-08-08 17:20:07	@Mandevwin	s/now/not
2018-08-08 17:20:07	ccccccc	I managed to manually delete all files within the winzip directory
2018-08-08 17:20:08	@TechSupport	Correction, <Mandevwin> the proper way to uninstall a program is to run the uninstaller. are you saying this is not what you did?
2018-08-08 17:20:17	ccccccc	Yeah I think so..
2018-08-08 17:20:20	@Mandevwin	ccccccc, that is not the proper way to uninstall a program
2018-08-08 17:20:34	ccccccc	I know.. I just wanted it gone since no other way would work for me
2018-08-08 17:20:50	ccccccc	Background processes wouldn't terminate and I tried 'uninstalling' properly but to no avail
2018-08-08 17:21:05	ccccccc	In retrospect I didn't need to get rid of it did i
2018-08-08 17:21:15	CoJaBo	Usually you can at least change the default to the not-broken one
2018-08-08 17:21:38	@Mandevwin	?speccy ccccccc 
2018-08-08 17:21:39	@TechSupport	https://goo.gl/1cf6VV — at the top of the Speccy window, go to File > Publish snapshot. Then, paste the link here.
2018-08-08 17:21:54	CoJaBo	In theory, you could also reinstall the same version that was deleted (ew), then uninstall it.
2018-08-08 17:21:57	ccccccc	I just assumed it was an add on that need not be there but yeah
2018-08-08 17:22:35	ccccccc	I don't actually have much to show -  I mean, the only issue I encountered this morning was trying to install an msi file and it wouldn't work because it couldn't find winzip
2018-08-08 17:23:34	ccccccc	Thus I installed 7 zip.. I guess I'm just wondering 1. if I've deleted a crucial piece of software that was all fine before I tamperedwith it 2. Will 7-zip be an ok replacement?
2018-08-08 17:24:15	ccccccc	Oh yeah I remember what I was trying to terminate in the background - winzip preloader..
2018-08-08 17:24:28	@Mandevwin	are you running windows 10?
2018-08-08 17:24:31	ccccccc	Yeah
2018-08-08 17:24:42	@Mandevwin	why the fuck do you need a third party zip program?
2018-08-08 17:24:45	ccccccc	bit confused because winzip is external right, its not loaded into windows 10 is it
2018-08-08 17:24:49	ccccccc	I don't
2018-08-08 17:24:54	@Mandevwin	windows 7 can open zips natively
2018-08-08 17:25:02	ccccccc	But.. i deleted winzip and the installer for the msi wouldn't work
2018-08-08 17:25:04	@Mandevwin	no winzip is shit software
2018-08-08 17:25:20	@Mandevwin	you need to touch up on file associations
2018-08-08 17:25:26	@Mandevwin	look up how to change them on google
2018-08-08 17:25:41	ccccccc	I assume windows can handle opening file types on its own
2018-08-08 17:25:46	CoJaBo	7zip is fine, but only really useful if you work with Linux archives
2018-08-08 17:26:08	ccccccc	but it wouldn't do it - I think it had some winzip temporary data it was trying to access or something
2018-08-08 17:26:23	ccccccc	so what i've done is make 7zip the opener for everything..
2018-08-08 17:26:43	ccccccc	would like it to just be stock windows and whatever windows does with zip files etc but yeah
2018-08-08 17:26:57	CoJaBo	Doesn't win10 have a "default apps" screen? I feel like there should be a setting for archives, that can be set to internal
2018-08-08 17:27:07	CoJaBo	I've never tried that before tho
2018-08-08 17:27:11	ccccccc	hmm
2018-08-08 17:27:49	ccccccc	See the only issue here is the fact that after installing software - namely, iFunbox which had some add on programs (one i was able to say no to) caused a new winzip shortcut on my desktop
2018-08-08 17:28:06	ccccccc	so i was like nah, I don't want that - it's foreign and scary lol so I got rid of it, forecfully

2018-08-08 17:28:37	ccccccc	Idk maybe winzip wasn't actually installed just overridden and shortcut created
2018-08-08 17:28:42	@Mandevwin	CoJaBo, you just set it to file explorer
2018-08-08 17:28:56	@Mandevwin	of course it was installed ccccccc 
2018-08-08 17:29:24	ccccccc	See when i downloaded the msi setup - top option was open with winzip - tried doing that and it wouldn't work
2018-08-08 17:29:25	@Mandevwin	you went and deleted the main program files, but didnt go in and delete the appdata and any registry entries that went with it
2018-08-08 17:29:33	newb	what is the preffered site to put my text file mandevwin?
2018-08-08 17:29:34	ccccccc	Yeah i think that nails it
2018-08-08 17:29:50	@Mandevwin	msi is an installer for windows. you dont extract those with archive tools
2018-08-08 17:29:54	ccccccc	next step? Delete app data and registry entities I guess
2018-08-08 17:30:09	@Mandevwin	newb, text file?
2018-08-08 17:30:23	@Mandevwin	ccccccc, i would not trust you to be messing around in the registry

2018-08-08 17:30:46	ccccccc	Ok no it was a zip file I downloaded.. but an msi installer in there
2018-08-08 17:30:54	@Mandevwin	newb, its a csv file, not text file 
2018-08-08 17:31:08	ccccccc	wouldn't do it, so i downloaded 7zip, I'd just like things to go back to the way they were without using 7zip
2018-08-08 17:31:18	ccccccc	just regular old whatever windows does to deal with it
2018-08-08 17:31:24	@Mandevwin	so change your file associations abck to file explorer
2018-08-08 17:31:30	ccccccc	how do i do that

2018-08-08 20:21:41	chasqui3	I need to delete some info from an online form. Cleared history, cleared cookies, all that jazz to try to get it off from my end. Host of the site says it's on THEIR end that the info is being saved, and they have no way to go in and manually remove it. So without the capability of having the form info completely removed, is there anything I can do
2018-08-08 20:21:41	chasqui3	 that would disable the fill recommendation?
2018-08-08 20:24:24	@whitewolf	if it's on their end then it's really their problem
2018-08-08 20:24:51	chasqui3	Ya from what it sounds like, theyre the only ones capable of actually removing the info.
2018-08-08 20:25:02	@whitewolf	seems like it
2018-08-08 20:25:08	chasqui3	for the time being until they get that ability, is their anything client side i can install or do that would make the suggestion not pop up

2018-08-08 20:26:05	chasqui3	also, the people didn't seem to know entirely what they were talking about, is it possible that the info is actually on my side? They said the info gets saved and tied to the account
2018-08-08 20:26:19	@whitewolf	it would help if you weren't being so vague
2018-08-08 20:26:22	chasqui3	meaning even if i change clients or devices that the info would still carry over because its tied to the account.
2018-08-08 20:26:23	@whitewolf	what is auto filling and where
2018-08-08 20:27:27	chasqui3	sorry, im soliciting help for someone else, i dont have the most details. Safari is auto filling an information form for a parking pass with an apartment complex. Fields are First and Last name, car make and model, and license plate number
2018-08-08 20:27:58	@whitewolf	does it auto fill if you try and use another browser
2018-08-08 20:28:02	chasqui3	and on clicking the first field, the first name field, it presents a suggestion to autocomplete the form with my name and information.
2018-08-08 20:28:25	chasqui3	I have asked them to try that but i'm not sure if they have unfortunately. that was my first suggestion as well
2018-08-08 20:28:45	@whitewolf	ok, have them try that and if it works then it's definitely safari
2018-08-08 20:29:05	@whitewolf	in that case try disabling everything in auto-fill
2018-08-08 20:29:23	chasqui3	and if it's just safari, what else can i do besides clearing everything out. I've already disabled the site in the autofill preferences and it still persists.
2018-08-08 20:29:56	chasqui3	cleared cookies, cleared cache, did a full history clear, disabled autofill for the site. none of those did anything
2018-08-08 20:30:20	@whitewolf	it's likely offering from your contacts
2018-08-08 20:30:33	@whitewolf	the default offer is from the 'me' card
2018-08-08 20:30:51	chasqui3	its my information, and my information is not in this persons contacts
2018-08-08 20:31:08	chasqui3	would contacts log info like that from safari? would it make me a contact card?
2018-08-08 20:31:14	@whitewolf	it could
2018-08-08 20:31:37	@whitewolf	does it offer an autofill for that name anywhere else a name field is asked
2018-08-08 20:32:00	chasqui3	interesting... havent thought of that possibility. and not that im aware of. as far as i know this is the only place my information has been provided
2018-08-08 20:32:20	chasqui3	I can try to find a random field and see if it pops up though
2018-08-08 20:32:51	@whitewolf	'been provided' might not matter - if it's stored that as the autofill contact it'll offer it for other name boxes
2018-08-08 20:33:38	chasqui3	gotcha. i'll have to give that a look. Have you ever heard of a site actually logging and tying the data provided to an account like that?? it's something i'd never heard of.
2018-08-08 20:34:15	chasqui3	and then also, if that doesnt work, are you aware of any extensions or downloads that would just completely disable the autofill function?
2018-08-08 20:34:27	@whitewolf	unchecking the autofill boxes in the prefs disables all that
2018-08-08 20:34:34	@whitewolf	that's not particularly unusual though
2018-08-08 20:34:42	@whitewolf	take amazon, you make an account and they store tons of info about you

2018-08-08 20:39:08	@whitewolf	if the autofill prompts in another browser, they're storing it on their end

2018-08-08 20:39:14	@whitewolf	test that first
2018-08-08 20:39:34	chasqui3	right i figured, we havent tried that yet, but we cant yet because she doesnt actually know the password for the site to get there because it autofills
2018-08-08 20:39:41	chasqui3	such a double edged bastard that autofill is haha

2018-08-08 20:40:13	chasqui3	that was my first suggestion too. try a different browser, try a different device. havent been able to yet because of the password issue. and its not a user generated password either, its generated on host end
2018-08-08 20:40:24	chasqui3	its on the to do list for tomorrow thoughy

2018-08-08 20:42:13	chasqui3	it just requires the user account password to get into those right?
2018-08-08 20:42:18	@whitewolf	yup
2018-08-08 20:42:25	@whitewolf	safari is probably the better choice if you're on macos
2018-08-08 20:42:31	@whitewolf	better battery life and whatnot
2018-08-08 20:42:58	@Virtual-Potato-2	you would know
2018-08-08 20:43:01	chasqui3	which she is. now, if the info actually does end up being on the site side of things, anything i can get installed or an extension or anything that would block it?
2018-08-08 20:43:28	@whitewolf	theoretically yes
2018-08-08 20:43:39	@whitewolf	practically, someone else can just login elsewhere

2018-08-08 20:44:23	@whitewolf	the problem is that he got himself a guest parking permit pass at his mistress' house and now he's afraid the dude or other person will see the guest pass request
2018-08-08 20:44:25	chasqui3	See that's what i said!!! i was like surely they cant be saying their site has the info of every person who has ever lived in this apartment
2018-08-08 20:44:43	@whitewolf	you probably login with the lease account to ask for guest parking
2018-08-08 20:44:56	@whitewolf	it would remember past guests for audit purposes
2018-08-08 20:45:03	@whitewolf	showing it to you is a nice to have if you keep inviting them over
2018-08-08 20:45:08	chasqui3	ahhhh makes sense
2018-08-08 20:45:20	@Virtual-Potato-2	That's why the computers in my apartment complex has deep freeze installed on it

2018-08-08 20:45:53	@whitewolf	their server stored the past guest that got guest parking
2018-08-08 20:46:10	chasqui3	but to reference what you just mentioned wolf, if the information is tied to the account, then wouldnt logging in somewhere else be irrelevant?
2018-08-08 20:46:10	@Virtual-Potato-2	Right if that's the case then yes, not even deep freeze can help you
2018-08-08 20:46:16	@whitewolf	correct
2018-08-08 20:46:17	chasqui3	if its tied to login it would pop up regardless
2018-08-08 20:46:18	@whitewolf	that's why you would check it
2018-08-08 20:46:48	chasqui3	check it to see if its account tied or device tied
2018-08-08 20:47:05	@whitewolf	yup
2018-08-08 20:47:09	@whitewolf	i suspect account
2018-08-08 20:47:14	@whitewolf	and i suspect you need a plan b
2018-08-08 20:47:25	chasqui3	im trying to find the plan b haha
2018-08-08 20:47:34	@Virtual-Potato-2	make sure to give her the plan b too
2018-08-08 20:47:47	chasqui3	extensions, secret settings, macos programs
2018-08-08 20:48:59	chasqui3	ok let me present something else really fast: i guess it might not technically be autofill, but in a user specific drop down menu?
2018-08-08 20:49:03	@Virtual-Potato-2	You know how easy it is to just say "Oh yeah my friend joe schmoe lives in apartment 112B over there" when someone calls you out on having your info in the system?
2018-08-08 20:49:26	chasqui3	but its not joe schmoe on the pass. it has my information
2018-08-08 20:49:39	@whitewolf	i think a better approach is to register 10 other random people with a guest pass
2018-08-08 20:49:45	@whitewolf	so the list has a confunding amount of information
2018-08-08 20:49:46	chasqui3	thats what i was thinking as well
2018-08-08 20:49:53	chasqui3	and just flood the drop down
2018-08-08 20:50:02	chasqui3	which would most likely alphabetize itself right?
2018-08-08 20:50:03	@whitewolf	you're never going to be able to solve this client side if it's a server side issue
2018-08-08 20:50:08	@whitewolf	they could simply login to the web portal on their phone for instance
2018-08-08 20:50:10	chasqui3	exactly
2018-08-08 20:50:23	@Virtual-Potato-2	figure out if they have a RESTful API and dump thousands of names in there
2018-08-08 20:50:27	@whitewolf	LOL
2018-08-08 20:50:37	@whitewolf	i'm sure dumping names in there will actually generate guest passes for them!
2018-08-08 20:50:40	chasqui3	im just looking for a bandaid, i dont need surgery , i just need a bandaid to not have this problem for a day or two
2018-08-08 20:50:47	@Virtual-Potato-2	no this is napalm
2018-08-08 20:50:53	@whitewolf	yeah this is napalm
2018-08-08 20:50:58	chasqui3	right i dont need napalm haha
2018-08-08 20:51:00	@whitewolf	counter-filling the list is just distraction
2018-08-08 20:51:08	chasqui3	i only need a distraction
2018-08-08 20:51:20	@whitewolf	until you wisk him or her off their feet and get a divorce? ;p
2018-08-08 20:51:20	@Virtual-Potato-2	if they're really that into you... a distraction won't stop them, not even a thousand names
2018-08-08 20:51:31	@Virtual-Potato-2	at that point you're boned already
2018-08-08 20:51:35	@Virtual-Potato-2	nothing you can do
2018-08-08 20:51:39	chasqui3	its not the one thats into me that needs to be distracted lol
2018-08-08 20:51:49	@whitewolf	its the dude or lady !
2018-08-08 20:52:07	@whitewolf	"oh bby chasqui3, come over and fuck me good -- i'll get you a guest pass"
2018-08-08 20:52:12	@whitewolf	mhm.
2018-08-08 20:52:15	chasqui3	oh no
2018-08-08 20:52:31	chasqui3	I needed the guest pass or i wouldve gotten towed :(
2018-08-08 20:52:37	@whitewolf	mhm
2018-08-08 20:52:41	@whitewolf	during your shag session
2018-08-08 20:52:43	@whitewolf	now you gotta cover it up
2018-08-08 20:52:45	@whitewolf	i getcha
2018-08-08 20:53:09	@Virtual-Potato-2	Is towing a new position that I've never heard of?
2018-08-08 20:53:16	@whitewolf	lol
2018-08-08 20:53:25	@whitewolf	future piece of advice, those forms don't need a real first and last name -- they only care about the plate and car that it's on
2018-08-08 20:53:25	chasqui3	right. So barring flooding the list with bogus info, anything i can do client side if it is a site side issue
2018-08-08 20:53:37	chasqui3	ya we realized that afterwards haha
2018-08-08 20:55:39	@PipeItToDevNull	no
2018-08-08 20:55:46	@whitewolf	i can't think of anything
2018-08-08 20:55:53	@PipeItToDevNull	Fill the backend and crash it 
2018-08-08 20:55:59	@whitewolf	maybe not the crashing part
2018-08-08 20:56:04	@PipeItToDevNull	 Idoubt they have checks 
2018-08-08 20:56:05	chasqui3	i need laymen terms friend
2018-08-08 20:56:30	@PipeItToDevNull	I mean fill it with so much fake info it cant run 
2018-08-08 20:56:44	chasqui3	it needs to be able to function though at some point
2018-08-08 20:57:01	chasqui3	thats the thing, the functionality of the site and form needs to be maintaine
2018-08-08 20:57:02	chasqui3	d
2018-08-08 20:58:29	@PipeItToDevNull	I do not understand where you stand in the issue, a victim or an owner 
2018-08-08 20:58:46	@Virtual-Potato-2	a lil SQL Injection might take care of it too
2018-08-08 20:58:59	@Virtual-Potato-2	something something DROP TABLE Users
2018-08-08 20:59:03	@PipeItToDevNull	lol, dump the table 
2018-08-08 20:59:15	chasqui3	potential victim. My info is saved in a drop down/autofill on a site, other people are going to need to use this site and functionality, when they do i cant have my information present
2018-08-08 20:59:34	@PipeItToDevNull	Burn it 
2018-08-08 20:59:36	@PipeItToDevNull	That is a data leak 
2018-08-08 20:59:39	@whitewolf	he doesn't want the dude/partner coming after him after he finds out chasqui3 plowed his partner
2018-08-08 20:59:45	@PipeItToDevNull	Ah
2018-08-08 20:59:46	@PipeItToDevNull	Fun shit 
2018-08-08 21:00:13	chasqui3	wolfie summed it up pretty decently haha, but my description is the technical side of things
2018-08-08 21:00:27	@whitewolf	gotta add a fair amount of humanity to it
2018-08-08 21:00:40	@whitewolf	because you did get with someone who's involved already ;p

2018-08-08 21:01:20	chasqui3	no no no, like i said it's just complicated. We all have moral failings, maybe this is one of mine
2018-08-08 21:01:39	chasqui3	but i need help because im trying to prevent a fallout here
2018-08-08 21:01:44	@whitewolf	understood
2018-08-08 21:01:46	@Virtual-Potato-2	we're not judging... maybe a little, but if this didn't happen it's still a data privacy concern
2018-08-08 21:01:54	@whitewolf	it's really not that concerning Virtual-Potato-2 
2018-08-08 21:02:06	@whitewolf	they login with their lease account and it shows them the guests they've invited in the past
2018-08-08 21:02:21	chasqui3	bingo, but only when prompted for someone elses info.
2018-08-08 21:02:26	@Virtual-Potato-2	hm
2018-08-08 21:02:39	@Virtual-Potato-2	wonder if you could make a new account with a new e-mail
2018-08-08 21:02:42	chasqui3	once the cursor hits the first field, the info is presented under the field
2018-08-08 21:02:49	@whitewolf	it wouldn't be tied to the lease, i thought about that
2018-08-08 21:02:53	chasqui3	office has said its account tied
2018-08-08 21:03:07	@Virtual-Potato-2	call the complex, say that you lost access to the old email account, can you please put the lease on this new e-mail account
2018-08-08 21:03:11	chasqui3	the info is tied to the account, the account is tied to the apartment
2018-08-08 21:03:16	chasqui3	doesnt matter ^^
2018-08-08 21:03:18	@whitewolf	it might not be tied to an email

2018-08-08 21:03:54	chasqui3	how so?
2018-08-08 21:03:56	@whitewolf	if you resubmit it, it might have a guest_id or something -- if you resubmit it with a different first and last name it might overwrite the old one
2018-08-08 21:04:02	@Virtual-Potato-2	Right
2018-08-08 21:04:15	@whitewolf	you'd have to be sure it will submit an update
2018-08-08 21:04:22	chasqui3	explain that a little bit more
2018-08-08 21:04:22	@whitewolf	if there's no reference to an id or anything there's no point in trying
2018-08-08 21:04:23	@Virtual-Potato-2	actually don't call the complex

2018-08-08 21:04:40	chasqui3	process wise, what does that involve. complex has already been called, site company has been called.
2018-08-08 21:04:45	chasqui3	nobody operates or maintains the site...

2018-08-08 21:05:05	@Virtual-Potato-2	it's in a database somewhere
2018-08-08 21:05:10	@Virtual-Potato-2	someone must have access to that database
2018-08-08 21:05:13	Dndraper	Evening everyone! Having slow download speeds with new router Asus 1900 (AC68U). Tried different settings and still have 4-5mbps download speed on Charter Spectrum. Can anyone on tech support provide suggestions?
2018-08-08 21:05:25	@whitewolf	Dndraper: are you connected wirelessly or wired?
2018-08-08 21:05:35	Dndraper	Wired from my laptop
2018-08-08 21:05:38	@whitewolf	Dndraper: what internet package do you pay for
2018-08-08 21:05:39	Dndraper	wireless*
2018-08-08 21:05:54	@Virtual-Potato-2	just call the company and say that you see some strange info in your account. Tell them to go and find their local database guy to take a look
2018-08-08 21:06:28	chasqui3	from the sound of it, there is no database guy. which seems bizarre to me. im gonna try calling in the morning.
2018-08-08 21:07:11	@Virtual-Potato-2	make up some BS. "Huh I've never seen this name before, why is it here? can you please delete it" but this might trigger an audit and have them investigate why it appeared in the first place... you don't wanna do that
2018-08-08 21:07:24	@Virtual-Potato-2	even better BS
2018-08-08 21:07:47	chasqui3	i havent been the one to call these places yet, i am going to in the morning and see what i can do
2018-08-08 21:07:56	@Virtual-Potato-2	"This guy was someone who hurt me.. I don't want to see this name ever again, can you please remove it - it's very emotional for me"
2018-08-08 21:08:20	@whitewolf	Dndraper: what internet package do you pay for?
2018-08-08 21:08:24	@Virtual-Potato-2	or anything you think might encourage them to remove it 
2018-08-08 21:09:04	chasqui3	because surely it HAS to be removable right? shouldn't every site have someone capable of getting read/write access to their sensitive information database?
2018-08-08 21:09:19	chasqui3	i mean first and last, car make and model and license plate are pretty identifying pieces of information
2018-08-08 21:09:27	@whitewolf	i'm not super happy about it but some of the software i wrote in the past would have required you to execute raw sql to remove something like that
2018-08-08 21:09:37	@Virtual-Potato-2	yes or at least be able to mark it as hidden
2018-08-08 21:09:57	chasqui3	im not familiar with the term raw sql
2018-08-08 21:09:58	Dndraper	Sorry, I have the 60mbps package
2018-08-08 21:10:22	chasqui3	right, i find it very difficult to believe that a widely used site like that has absolutely no access to their own databse
2018-08-08 21:10:28	@whitewolf	Dndraper: do you get substantially better speeds if you wire in?
2018-08-08 21:10:31	@Virtual-Potato-2	chasqui3, it's a way of interacting with the database - you execute sql commands to manipulate the database
2018-08-08 21:11:00	Dndraper	I'll try it now but when I had it set up earlier this week, I was getting way faster speeds
2018-08-08 21:11:05	chasqui3	@Virtual-Potato-2 ah i see
2018-08-08 21:11:12	@Virtual-Potato-2	normally, people click on a program that executes the sql commands to add/modify/remove stuff from the database
2018-08-08 21:11:21	chasqui3	is that something anyone can do?
2018-08-08 21:11:22	@Virtual-Potato-2	but sometimes some programs don't allow you to remove stuff
2018-08-08 21:11:33	Dndraper	Im not sure what happened during the last couple of days but I had to change some settings to allow my smart tvs to connect. I reset to factory default and created new SSIDs
2018-08-08 21:11:48	@Virtual-Potato-2	but since it's a database, you can login to the database directly and execute the correct commands to do so, even though the program might not allow you to do so
2018-08-08 21:11:48	chasqui3	i mean if this place doesnt even have a body on hand to manage the database, surely their permissions wont be too bad
2018-08-08 21:12:50	@whitewolf	Dndraper: let's check wired first, then we can move to checking wireless settings
2018-08-08 21:13:19	@Virtual-Potato-2	chasqui3, scroll down to the bottom of the site, it'll usually tell you who owns the site or maintains it.. For example, for my apartment complex it uses RentCafe / Yardi Systems
2018-08-08 21:14:11	chasqui3	@virtual-potato-2 i know who owns and operates the site, shes been in contact with them. theyre the ones who said they have nobody there or point of contact to get into the site
2018-08-08 21:14:20	@Virtual-Potato-2	bs
2018-08-08 21:14:30	chasqui3	RIGHT
2018-08-08 21:14:47	chasqui3	thats what i said!! i was like i do not believe that this website has nobody maintaining it or nobody who has access to it
2018-08-08 21:15:12	@Virtual-Potato-2	ask the apartment complex to ask them "Who fixes it if the site goes down?"

2018-08-08 21:16:56	@Virtual-Potato-2	have the complex say that they're working on an emergency preparedness plan and they want to make sure their business can run if they're not able to contact the site owner and the site's down
2018-08-08 21:17:57	@Virtual-Potato-2	most of the time they won't give out contact info of the maintainer because the current PoC is basically the middleman between their customers (complexes) and their engineers

2018-08-08 21:33:56	@whitewolf	Dndraper:  so with wired you're still at 3-5 megabits eh
2018-08-08 21:34:13	@whitewolf	to be clear, you're measuring in megabits and not megabytes right?
2018-08-08 21:34:23	Dndraper	Yea. I used Fast.com
2018-08-08 21:34:39	@whitewolf	do you get a better speed from e.g speedtest.net
2018-08-08 21:34:55	@Virtual-Potato-2	mb/s or mbps = megabits per second; MB/s or MBps = megaBYTES per second
2018-08-08 21:35:16	@whitewolf	fast measures in mbit
2018-08-08 21:35:25	@Virtual-Potato-2	I'm just saying
2018-08-08 21:36:11	Dndraper	Speedtest gives me the same or about the same
2018-08-08 21:36:32	Dndraper	actually just finished. its a bit lower at 3.80 Mbps
2018-08-08 21:36:33	@whitewolf	the next step is to plug into the modem directly, reboot it, then reconnect and test your speed directly
2018-08-08 21:36:43	@whitewolf	if it's still slow it's your ISP probably
2018-08-08 21:36:58	@whitewolf	suppose we should test another device first
2018-08-08 21:37:09	Dndraper	I tried connecting to my modem directly yesterday
2018-08-08 21:37:29	Dndraper	but I kept getting no internet connection from there. I spoke with the ISP and they said it was working fine
2018-08-08 21:37:55	Dndraper	My phone was reporting about 5Mbps
2018-08-08 21:38:07	@whitewolf	did you reboot the modem?
2018-08-08 21:38:13	@whitewolf	you have to power cycle it when switching MACs usually
2018-08-08 21:39:04	Dndraper	Haven't rebooted the modem today. I could give it a try
2018-08-08 21:39:11	@whitewolf	i mean with the laptop directly plugged in
2018-08-08 21:39:17	@whitewolf	unplug router, plug in laptop, reboot cable modem
2018-08-08 21:39:19	@whitewolf	retest speed
2018-08-08 21:39:52	@whitewolf	when you switch back to the router you need to power cycle the cable modem again

2018-08-08 22:22:29	@PipeItToDevNull	Why are you still at it with this POS 
2018-08-08 22:22:34	poo4theloo	keeps on sayinf i need permission
2018-08-08 22:22:46	poo4theloo	it's not the POS, th ePOS is windows
2018-08-08 22:22:54	@PipeItToDevNull	No, it is hte NAS 
2018-08-08 22:22:54	poo4theloo	this is a windoes  problem
2018-08-08 22:22:59	poo4theloo	no it is windoews
2018-08-08 22:23:01	@PipeItToDevNull	It took how long to get it reading a disk?
2018-08-08 22:23:05	poo4theloo	th edrive is mapped in windows
2018-08-08 22:23:15	@PipeItToDevNull	it is a piece of shit 
2018-08-08 22:23:16	poo4theloo	yeah i know
2018-08-08 22:23:28	@DoctorDick	That's a permissions issue on the NAS
2018-08-08 22:23:45	poo4theloo	because they retarfds at asus  tech support  told me i didn;t need to mapthe drive in windows, afte ri mapped it i was able to read and write to ti
2018-08-08 22:24:12	poo4theloo	ok yes it is a pice of shit but this  is a problem with windows
2018-08-08 22:24:52	poo4theloo	the only   permissions in the NAS  is  R/W and it is on
2018-08-08 22:25:01	poo4theloo	it is set to admin R/w enabled
2018-08-08 22:25:09	@PipeItToDevNull	The sharing server sets permissions 
2018-08-08 22:25:25	poo4theloo	i can access the drive in 2 ways from windows explorer
2018-08-08 22:26:20	poo4theloo	from network  i can see but i can do fuckall i can not read or write to it at all ,  then  under this PC it is listed again with the drive letter after it since i mapped it
2018-08-08 22:26:35	poo4theloo	if i go to it that way i can  read and write to it
2018-08-08 22:26:51	poo4theloo	but i can not delete large files but i can  small ones
2018-08-08 22:27:02	@PipeItToDevNull	Because the NAS is a POS 
2018-08-08 22:27:05	@PipeItToDevNull	That is not Windows 
2018-08-08 22:27:56	poo4theloo	for example if i put a   .png file in the folder  i can  move it into a sub folder in the main folder , but if i try the same thing with a file that is 1.75GB it says i need permission
2018-08-08 22:28:03	poo4theloo	same goes for delete
2018-08-08 22:28:08	@PipeItToDevNull	Yes, NAS 
2018-08-08 22:28:25	poo4theloo	i can delte the .png files but lagrer files like the 1.75 GBfile it says i need permission to delete it
2018-08-08 22:28:46	@PipeItToDevNull	The sharing server sets permissions 
2018-08-08 22:29:43	poo4theloo	this seems to be a   windows permission problem too ,  i mean yea the NAS is  shit , if i try and acces the drive  from network places > router model> drive name?main folder  theni cant do anyhting
2018-08-08 22:30:37	poo4theloo	but  i mapped it in windows and it shows up again with the drive letter , i can now read and writeit but like i said small  files can be moved and delted but not larger ones or it asks for permissions
2018-08-08 22:30:51	@PipeItToDevNull	If you want to blame windows, then dont use NTFS 
2018-08-08 22:31:14	@PipeItToDevNull	other FS wont store the same permissions 
2018-08-08 22:31:16	poo4theloo	what difference does that make?
2018-08-08 22:31:30	@whitewolf	a ton heh
2018-08-08 22:31:37	poo4theloo	so if i had formatted it to exfat i would not have this problem
2018-08-08 22:31:50	@whitewolf	if it's truely permissions perhaps not
2018-08-08 22:32:00	@whitewolf	if it's a shitty nas rejecting SMB commands, nope
2018-08-08 22:32:31	poo4theloo	i think  this is windows permission issue the settings are really fucked up i can not understand any of this shit
2018-08-08 22:32:39	@whitewolf	you would be incorrect
2018-08-08 22:32:44	poo4theloo	let me take a screen cap

2018-08-08 22:54:47	@whitewolf	when you map a drive it uses SMB to communicate with it

2018-08-08 22:55:13	@whitewolf	samba, an implementation of smb for linux, is how home routers serve shares to windows machines
2018-08-08 22:55:22	@whitewolf	they can use homegroups/workgroups to discover the mounts using a fucked up protocol
2018-08-08 22:55:27	@whitewolf	or you can map them directly
2018-08-08 22:55:44	@whitewolf	the effect is the same, you likely can't r/w when you don't map it because the guest user is mapping to nobody and nobody has no permissions
2018-08-08 22:55:56	poo4theloo	so is the one that is showing up that is not under network that i mapped mapped directly then?
2018-08-08 22:56:12	@whitewolf	it is, but you likely connect as a different user when you browse it that way
2018-08-08 22:56:16	@whitewolf	the solution, in all cases, is on the server side when the server is a linux or unix daemon hosting it

2018-08-08 22:56:45	@whitewolf	probably a crappy version of samba
2018-08-08 22:57:09	@whitewolf	the solution is either: [1] pay more for your NAS than a crappy home router; or [2] try custom firmware like openwrt
2018-08-08 22:57:35	@whitewolf	once you do [2], we can actually make some kind of progress on debugging it
2018-08-08 22:57:44	@whitewolf	but stop blaming windows, because it's not really windows' problem here
2018-08-08 22:57:59	poo4theloo	yes it is stock router FW yes it had samba , but under network i think it is samba but   i also mapped the drive agiain so it shows twice if i got the one under network there a bunch of folder i did not create like video  music  etc
2018-08-08 22:58:16	@whitewolf	their crappy firmware made those folders
2018-08-08 22:58:22	@whitewolf	it also made the place you're mapping when you map the drive
2018-08-08 22:58:24	poo4theloo	i know that
2018-08-08 22:58:35	@whitewolf	which is a different root, which you're connecting to by being a different user
2018-08-08 22:58:44	@whitewolf	fix it on the router, the problem is on the router; if you can't change enough settings to fix it, use the custom firmware
2018-08-08 22:58:55	@whitewolf	i guarantee this is some strange SMB issue that you're not going to get anywhere on until you listen and do
2018-08-08 22:59:03	poo4theloo	but afte ri mapped it it shows up and i do not see those folders if i access it from this PC>  drive letter
2018-08-08 22:59:09	@whitewolf	ok?
2018-08-08 22:59:18	@whitewolf	the cool thing about network servers is they can show you whatever they want
2018-08-08 22:59:22	@whitewolf	they're not just dumps of the drive
2018-08-08 22:59:31	@whitewolf	that's why your permissions attempts are futile at best, you're not changing shit
2018-08-08 23:00:02	@whitewolf	so if you browse it anonymously, you might see one thing; if you connect as a user, like admin, you can see something totally different

2018-08-08 23:00:22	poo4theloo	i am waiting for  SBC's to get a little better and get something like an odroid to setup a NAS, something with USB 3.0 and that does not boot from SD
2018-08-08 23:00:49	hatrick	I missed what is actually happening but can't you just turn off netbios and then only used your mapped drive?

2018-08-08 23:03:56	hatrick	And yes windows is a component, doesn't mean it ends there.

2018-08-08 23:05:03	@whitewolf	good luck.
2018-08-08 23:05:28	hatrick	No Apple is constantly refusing to implement maximal values instead of default values so SMB won't work. It's not hard they just don't want SMB to work and to be able to say "we implemented spec"

2018-08-08 23:29:50	hatrick	My recommend is boot up linux and test each SMB version until you find a difference.

2018-08-08 23:42:04	jbdman	I've got quite a strange issue. On a generally fresh install of windows 10, something keeps killing TCP connections randomly, and at will. For example: Chrome downloads will stall at 0KB/s in the middle of the download, discord randomly cuts out and reconnects, a Java based IP KVM (Dell iDrac) cuts out completely at random intervals. I can post a list of programs, as soon as I can figure out how...
2018-08-08 23:42:17	@Virtual-Potato-2	the gtx 1070 is actually an external GPU, connected to my laptop
2018-08-08 23:42:51	@whitewolf	that sounds more likely to be some kind of network stack or driver issue

2018-08-08 23:57:29	hatrick	jbdman_, you can't install the drivers in an old installation. You need to put them on a USB drive or slipstream them. I think you should try just reinserting

2018-08-09 00:41:02	GRONT	temps are maybe a little high but otherwise normal
2018-08-09 00:41:26	gtx560	I had an older psu the one that came in this computer had no plug in for the gpu
2018-08-09 00:41:47	gtx560	the older psu is better than the one that came in this comp, 270w and this one is 400w
2018-08-09 00:42:09	hatrick	GRONT what fan model

2018-08-09 00:45:43	GRONT	its possible there was very very slight pressure put on the fan, but man, im talking light.
2018-08-09 00:46:41	GRONT	im looking for any ideas that dont immediately involve taking everything apart and redoing it, because, everytime this thing gets opened up i have an issue, im an idiot.
2018-08-09 00:48:50	hatrick	find a way to kill any RGB bull with a passion, really that's what turns this from a few metrics into a fairly broad range of potential issues. Does the BIOS allow you to turn that off?
2018-08-09 00:49:39	GRONT	the rgb? i dont believe so, the options seemed very limited in the bios
2018-08-09 00:50:22	hatrick	There is a global option, try turning that off
2018-08-09 00:50:44	hatrick	Under Advanced
2018-08-09 00:51:03	hatrick	check fan speed while in there
2018-08-09 00:51:07	GRONT	youll have to give me a few moments.
2018-08-09 00:51:10	GRONT	ill be back!

2018-08-09 00:57:44	GRONT	Ok, so, combing through options i found the option to turn off my ignore cpu fan monitoring, left the cpu opt on since thats the actual fan. I turned off my boards RGB, but there was no option or rather the only option didnt turn off the coolers rgb.
2018-08-09 00:58:07	GRONT	With that said, it DID NOT give me the error message, but it seemed to add about 20 seconds to my boot time (ssd super quick)
2018-08-09 01:00:13	GRONT	with that said, im willing to call it case closed since i really dont want to risk myself f/cking something up reseating everything and rebuilding. Its just really odd because all i did was insert ram.
2018-08-09 01:00:29	GRONT	the rams out and it'll stay in comp#2 for now
2018-08-09 01:02:14	hatrick	Find a normal non-rgb no controller or other weirdness PWM fan and plug it into cpu pins with RGB turned on. If you get no error message then there is no need to worry about your mobo.
2018-08-09 01:02:41	hatrick	Don't not test something that may bite you later

2018-08-09 01:05:19	hatrick	Oh, you should be able to disable RGB from within some ASUS Aura software, try disabling RGB cpu in that and re-enable RGB in BIOS.
2018-08-09 01:12:55	hatrick	It's driving me nuts now. Does anybody know how a 4 pin PWM RGB fan works? Is there some kind of standardized one-wire circuit on the PWM pin or is some kind of constant encoding within the modulation used?

2018-08-09 01:21:30	hatrick	beepnboop It's a complex process for the drivers you need. You can find a wealth of information about the different processes and ways of doing so under the general header of slipstreaming. First explore loading the driver at install time, then slipstreaming, then where your actual potential solution lies is manual editing of the installation media.

2018-08-09 15:10:16	FelixMage	Donjuanal My bad, neither the machine nor the DVD should have been touched by the company though, they act only as an inbetweener between the manufacturer and the customer
2018-08-09 15:10:44	FelixMage	Donjuanal I'll try to figure it out, thanks for trying to help me, really appreciate it.
2018-08-09 15:10:49	@Donjuanal	FelixMage, understood but because this isn't your personal machine we have to wipe our hands
2018-08-09 15:11:18	@Donjuanal	FelixMage, also amybe try installing and skipping activation? or doing an "upgrade" via windows itself
2018-08-09 15:12:01	ki2	how does he find out motherboard ?

2018-08-09 15:12:43	FelixMage	Donjuanal Right, I understand, though I might have accidentally shot myself in the foot, as I actually likely own it entirely, it's just subsidised(not sure if that's the right word for it) from the company
2018-08-09 15:13:12	@Donjuanal	FelixMage, is this your personal laptop?
2018-08-09 15:13:51	FelixMage	Donjuanal Yes, it was purchased through the vendor owned by my company, however I own it entirely.
2018-08-09 15:14:15	ki2	Is it wise to mess with reinstalling network drivers if his Dad built the PC and we don't know exactly which drivers it needs to get back online?
2018-08-09 15:14:26	ki2	The ethernet has to connect to an extra attachment on his pc lol
2018-08-09 15:15:01	FelixMage	Donjuanal It's a 'work machine" in the sense that I plan on using it to do my job, not by being owned by anyone other than me.
2018-08-09 15:15:12	@Donjuanal	FelixMage, try going to settings->update and security->activation->change product key
2018-08-09 15:20:05	FelixMage	Donjuanal Went there, tried the Product Key, says it doesn't work, error (0xc004f050)
2018-08-09 15:20:30	FelixMage	Donjuanal Probably a faulty Product Key then?
2018-08-09 15:20:37	@Donjuanal	yep
2018-08-09 15:20:51	@Donjuanal	try going to the windows store
2018-08-09 15:21:09	@Donjuanal	put in the digital key and it'll tell you if its valid or not
2018-08-09 15:22:11	FelixMage	Donjuanal As in the store option in the settings, or using a browser?
2018-08-09 15:22:35	@Donjuanal	either
2018-08-09 15:23:17	FelixMage	Donjuanal The one in the settings opens up the same dialog window as the Change Product Key one, and gives the same error
2018-08-09 15:23:27	@Donjuanal	try the website then
2018-08-09 15:23:42	@Donjuanal	but it's looking like a defunct key
2018-08-09 15:25:00	Swagpole	I'm confused, does it give the error after entering the key, or right after hitting change key
2018-08-09 15:25:13	@Donjuanal	after entering the key
2018-08-09 15:25:18	@Donjuanal	the error indicates an invalid key too
2018-08-09 15:25:28	Swagpole	which OS
2018-08-09 15:25:31	Swagpole	10?
2018-08-09 15:25:41	FelixMage	Donjuanal Win 10 Pro
2018-08-09 15:25:51	FelixMage	My bad should have been at Swagpole
2018-08-09 15:26:02	Swagpole	okay, i have a crazy sounding suggestion, but its worked for me in the past
2018-08-09 15:26:16	FelixMage	Honestly, it seems like it's just faulty. Still strange since I got it from a vendor that really should be reputable
2018-08-09 15:26:47	FelixMage	Swagpole I'm willing to try
2018-08-09 15:27:07	Swagpole	I've had known good keys get rejected from windows before. Theres a specific key you put in, and windows denies it as an invalid key, BUT after you do that, you put back in your origional key, and it works
2018-08-09 15:27:10	Swagpole	its fucking strange
2018-08-09 15:27:16	Swagpole	but ive had it work for me before
2018-08-09 15:27:38	FelixMage	Swagpole The original key in the computer right now is for the Home version though

2018-08-09 15:43:08	@Donjuanal	you need a powered converter to go from dvi-d to vga

2018-08-09 15:43:29	helpme	converter?? searching now.

2018-08-09 17:53:51	@Mandevwin	oh nvm
2018-08-09 17:53:58	charloalberto	I think that the natural glue just dried out, and the screen is just coming off
2018-08-09 17:54:06	@Mandevwin	the issue is with your service provider or the wiring, HavocDefused 
2018-08-09 17:54:15	@Mandevwin	you have tested with direct modem access

2018-08-09 17:55:34	@Mandevwin	change your dns to 8.8.8.8 (primary) and 8.8.4.4 (secondary)

2018-08-09 19:30:42	@TechSupport	(Narcolapser) Hard drive partition not being found on raspberry pi after reformat : techsupport - 0 comments, 1 point - Narcolapser, 1h ago
2018-08-09 19:31:03	Narcolapser	in short, desktop sees it, old rpi saw it, reformated rpi doesn't.
2018-08-09 19:31:35	@PipeItToDevNull	move all the data off, format, put it back 
2018-08-09 19:31:54	Narcolapser	I don't have 650gb of space available though. it IS my mass storage.
2018-08-09 19:32:01	Narcolapser	is there any other option?
2018-08-09 19:32:12	@PipeItToDevNull	I am perplexed by the concern for data that isnt backed up 
2018-08-09 19:33:32	Narcolapser	it's the media drive where we've been centralizing to. The data itself is backed up, but it would take many hours to reconstruct it's layout since no one place has all of it.
2018-08-09 19:34:17	Narcolapser	Some of the files are transcoded video files, again, we have other copies but it would take hours to reconstruct.

2018-08-09 19:52:35	+Lynn25	Narcolapser, what happened to the pi that made you reinstall the os?
2018-08-09 19:53:30	Narcolapser	not sure. It wasn't booting. Got stuck on something about "loading system config" I don't remember the specifics. I googled the problem and people were saying "oh, your SOL"
2018-08-09 19:54:01	Narcolapser	But this is the exact reason why I went with the docker setup. Wipe the card, reload, pull down the containers and I'm back in business.
2018-08-09 19:54:21	Narcolapser	But the containers need the drive to run so I ground to a halt real fast in this process.

2018-08-09 20:06:02	+Lynn25	As for creating a new partition, if it's read on another machine fine then I don't think anything is wrong with the hard drive itself so I don't think rebuilding the partition will help

2018-08-09 20:13:11	+Lynn25	So the thing with Raspberry Pis is that they are not super resilient and the slightest hickup can cause it to do weird things (from my experience at least). So we have to figure out if it's the hard drive specifically or the raspberry pi. Do you have another hard drive laying around that you can create a partition on and plug into it?

Disk management has my Win7 partition furthest to the right, so "Extend Volume" is greyed out. I read you could get around this by using EaseUS Partition Master. When I move the Win7 partition using this tool, it remains
2018-08-09 20:28:13	Orcley	 in the same place on reboot. Any ideas? (I'm not sure if this is the correct format for posting issues here)

2018-08-09 20:31:30	Orcley	I'm afraid I don't understand. Is there a quick fix to merging the 100gb unallocated?

2018-08-09 20:45:44	Narcolapser	If you have any other ideas @Lynn25 feel free to drop me a line in the thread on r/techsupport. Thanks for your help.

2018-08-09 20:47:56	GodTierWizard	So I did testing again and it seems like I'm still having the same issues. High CPU usage on loading certain programs like chrome, and in certain games on loading screens. But it steadily returns to normal after loading. Any chance it might be a hardware issue? Any insight would be appreciated.

2018-08-09 22:10:08	Guest97238	So it prints super slow. When I'm printing any sort of document, it takes about an hour to get through a page. Like when printers used parallel cables and would make one pass, wait half a minute, and repeat. It's an HP PSC2510. Happens both when connected to USB, or copying standalone

2018-08-09 22:11:48	@PipeItToDevNull	Guest97238, that sounds like a fucked printer, that is nothing to do with the client. I doubt it would be hardware, so I am left thinking firmware 
2018-08-09 22:12:57	Guest97238	That's what I was thinking. I've looked everywhere to find new firmware, but no luck. Let alone figuring out how to install it.

2018-08-10 08:23:06	IceMage	Hi, I was here recently asking for help with my internet connection (or rather, lack thereof) on my laptop. So here's what I know...my laptop is the only thing that i'm having connection issues on. Restarting windows and network troubleshooter didn't help. I bought a new ethernet cable since the last time I was here and that doesn't work either. An
2018-08-10 08:23:06	IceMage	yone have any suggestions as to what I may need to do?
2018-08-10 08:30:28	Voop	how does the problem manifest itself
2018-08-10 08:30:48	Voop	are you not seeing connections, are you not seeing network hardware at all
2018-08-10 08:31:02	Voop	IceMage
2018-08-10 08:31:16	IceMage	There's a little yellow triangle with exclamation mark over the connection icon
2018-08-10 08:31:47	Voop	what does it say when you hover over it
2018-08-10 08:32:02	IceMage	Someone tried to tell me that means the connection is metered....but that is NOT the case because the connection is not set to metered
2018-08-10 08:32:43	Voop	yeah ive only seen that happen when the DNS server is messed up or its a metered connection
2018-08-10 08:32:56	IceMage	It says "unidentified network no internet access"
2018-08-10 08:33:20	Voop	is this your own internet connection
2018-08-10 08:33:35	IceMage	Yes. How do I check the DNS stuff?
2018-08-10 08:33:54	Voop	sometimes the troubleshooter finds it, sometimes it doesnt
2018-08-10 08:34:11	IceMage	In my case i guess it doesn't :/
2018-08-10 08:34:19	Voop	i doubt theres a dns problem if your other computers dont have the issue
2018-08-10 08:35:09	Voop	are you pointed to googles dns
2018-08-10 08:35:56	IceMage	I don't think so..how do I check?

2018-08-10 08:39:29	DeadRabbitHopes	Hello guys i don't know if is a techsupport but still.  Maybe someone know is it possible to create "playlist.mkv" (for example: I have 13 episodes and wanna open one file to play them 1-13 in entirety) how can I do that ?
2018-08-10 08:40:09	@Donjuanal	DeadRabbitHopes, mkv is matroska video container, just make a playlist in the video player of your choice with all 13 files
2018-08-10 08:40:18	@Donjuanal	and then save the playlist
2018-08-10 08:40:28	IceMage	@donjuanal it says connected, but no internet
2018-08-10 08:40:40	DeadRabbitHopes	can i do it in windows media player ?
2018-08-10 08:40:59	@Donjuanal	IceMage, open an admin cmd and ru ipconfig /all and share the output for us
2018-08-10 08:41:03	Voop	IceMage: control panel > network and sharing center > right click on the connection, properties
2018-08-10 08:41:05	@Donjuanal	DeadRabbitHopes, wmp can't play mkv files
2018-08-10 08:41:15	@Donjuanal	*run
2018-08-10 08:41:16	Voop	then click on internet protocol version 4 and click properties
2018-08-10 08:41:23	Voop	the dns information will be there
2018-08-10 08:41:31	@Donjuanal	Voop, ipconfig /all will be better
2018-08-10 08:41:39	Voop	probably

2018-08-10 08:42:45	@PipeItToDevNull	make a USB 
2018-08-10 08:42:48	Rambocreativity	I did this
2018-08-10 08:42:53	Rambocreativity	It's doing nothing
2018-08-10 08:42:57	@Donjuanal	don't factory reset, clean install
2018-08-10 08:42:59	@PipeItToDevNull	And you are booting the USB?
2018-08-10 08:42:59	Rambocreativity	None of the efi files do anything
2018-08-10 08:43:03	Rambocreativity	Yes
2018-08-10 08:43:08	@PipeItToDevNull	What EFI files 
2018-08-10 08:43:14	@PipeItToDevNull	You shouldnt see EFI files 
2018-08-10 08:43:23	@Donjuanal	Rambocreativity, how did you make the usb?
2018-08-10 08:43:27	Rambocreativity	idk I put windows iso on usb
2018-08-10 08:43:33	@Donjuanal	thats not how it works
2018-08-10 08:43:38	Rambocreativity	What
2018-08-10 08:43:42	Rambocreativity	Now I'm confused
2018-08-10 08:43:43	@Donjuanal	you need to burn the iso to usb with a tool like rufus
2018-08-10 08:43:46	@PipeItToDevNull	How did you put the ISO on the USB 
2018-08-10 08:43:48	Rambocreativity	I
2018-08-10 08:43:48	Rambocreativity	did
2018-08-10 08:43:54	Rambocreativity	Rufus
2018-08-10 08:43:55	@PipeItToDevNull	Use the MCT

2018-08-10 08:44:03	Rambocreativity	sure
2018-08-10 08:44:09	Voop	lol*

2018-08-10 08:44:24	Voop	write the iso to the usb
2018-08-10 08:44:29	Rambocreativity	It didn't do it all though
2018-08-10 08:44:35	Voop	oh, rufus
2018-08-10 08:44:55	Voop	win32diskimager is easier than rufus
2018-08-10 08:45:02	@PipeItToDevNull	Win32 is for SDs and that is about it, better tools exist otherwise 
2018-08-10 08:45:03	Rambocreativity	I actually don't know what you mean by MCT
2018-08-10 08:45:04	Voop	less settings to mess up

2018-08-10 08:52:51	Voop	when you start the machine, it should say press (key) to enter bios
2018-08-10 08:52:57	Rambocreativity	Nope
2018-08-10 08:53:03	@PipeItToDevNull	Boot, that should be a tab or section

2018-08-10 09:06:48	IceMage	@donjuanal @Voop OK so i rebooted and seems like the problem still remains....bah
2018-08-10 09:06:49	@PipeItToDevNull	So you are destroying it and accomplishing nothing with that destruction 
2018-08-10 09:07:02	Voop	Rambocreativity: HP Pavilion?
2018-08-10 09:07:06	Rambocreativity	Correct.
2018-08-10 09:08:58	Voop	ok you want to restart it and hit F5
2018-08-10 09:09:07	Voop	rapid fire F9 i mean
2018-08-10 09:09:48	Voop	should give you the boot device options
2018-08-10 09:10:15	Rambocreativity	correct
2018-08-10 09:10:34	Rambocreativity	That's were I was when you said "how can you see the efi files?"
2018-08-10 09:11:00	Voop	USB should be on the list
2018-08-10 09:11:21	Rambocreativity	OS Boot Manager
2018-08-10 09:11:29	Rambocreativity	Boot From EFI File
2018-08-10 09:11:31	Rambocreativity	That's it.
2018-08-10 09:11:35	IceMage	@voop @donjuanal any more ideas for debugging this problem..?
2018-08-10 09:11:41	Voop	the first one
2018-08-10 09:11:53	Rambocreativity	Went instantly to loading.
2018-08-10 09:12:02	Voop	IceMage: 1 sec
2018-08-10 09:12:03	Rambocreativity	Black screen.
2018-08-10 09:13:10	Rambocreativity	Atleast that's what will follow shortly after because I did an OS Boot Manager before and waited 12 hours, and it was still loading.
2018-08-10 09:13:25	Rambocreativity	Sometimes blackscreen, sometimes it loads forever.
2018-08-10 09:13:28	Voop	alright go back into the bios
2018-08-10 09:13:36	Voop	and find the boot priority
2018-08-10 09:13:43	Voop	i can tell you its not under main
2018-08-10 09:14:14	Rambocreativity	No such command exists.
2018-08-10 09:14:15	Voop	probably under config
2018-08-10 09:15:09	Rambocreativity	None of them even have Priority in them, and only 4 have boot in the name.
2018-08-10 09:15:22	Voop	which ones have boot in the name
2018-08-10 09:15:58	Rambocreativity	CD Rom Boot, Network Boot Protocol, Secure Boot, OS Boot Manager
2018-08-10 09:16:09	Voop	IceMage: you could try forgetting the network then reconnecting to it
2018-08-10 09:16:30	Voop	can you burn the iso to a disk
2018-08-10 09:16:40	Rambocreativity	What.
2018-08-10 09:16:48	Rambocreativity	Don't have a disk, have a external hard drive tho.
2018-08-10 09:17:22	Voop	have you tried hitting f11 at startup and entering recovery mode
2018-08-10 09:17:36	Voop	theres a non zero chance theres something about clean installing windows there
2018-08-10 09:17:46	IceMage	@Voop I think I tried that already and had no luck
2018-08-10 09:17:54	Rambocreativity	I've said today and yesterday I believe that that is not an option anymore because doing so takes me straight to loading and nothing else.
2018-08-10 09:18:03	@Donjuanal	IceMage, try netsh winsock reset and another reboot
2018-08-10 09:19:04	IceMage	k, trying now

2018-08-10 09:58:50	@Mandevwin	to the usb?
2018-08-10 09:59:07	Rambocreativity	Yes.
2018-08-10 09:59:12	Rambocreativity	I will do it again.
2018-08-10 09:59:15	@Mandevwin	what usb device are you attempting to boot to?
2018-08-10 09:59:26	@Donjuanal	it better be a thumg drive
2018-08-10 09:59:30	@Mandevwin	yeah
2018-08-10 09:59:33	Rambocreativity	An External hard drive with Windows.ISO on it.
2018-08-10 09:59:37	@Donjuanal	IceMage, you did specifically safemode with networking right?
2018-08-10 09:59:40	@Mandevwin	yeah that's not how this works
2018-08-10 09:59:45	Rambocreativity	???
2018-08-10 09:59:58	@Donjuanal	Rambocreativity, your burned the windows iso to the hdd using rufus?
2018-08-10 10:00:02	@Donjuanal	*you
2018-08-10 10:00:06	Rambocreativity	Yes.
2018-08-10 10:00:11	Rambocreativity	And used the MCT tool
2018-08-10 10:00:18	@Donjuanal	windows does not like to boot of external hdd's
2018-08-10 10:00:24	@Donjuanal	you need to use a usb
2018-08-10 10:00:28	@Mandevwin	ive never had luck with it
2018-08-10 10:00:29	@Donjuanal	like you did with linux
2018-08-10 10:00:29	Rambocreativity	It did it like 3 hours ago, just fine.
2018-08-10 10:00:40	Rambocreativity	And it did it when I FIRST tried to install windows.
2018-08-10 10:00:52	Rambocreativity	Not damn problem.
2018-08-10 10:00:54	IceMage	@donjuanal Yes, I started in safe mode w/ networking and the problem is the same; stupid yellow triangle over connection icon
2018-08-10 10:01:08	Voop	wait so you got this to work before?
2018-08-10 10:01:18	Voop	replicate those conditions; problem solved
2018-08-10 10:01:18	@Donjuanal	IceMage, so dhcp is whats not functioning, try linx
2018-08-10 10:01:21	@Donjuanal	*linux
2018-08-10 10:01:21	@Mandevwin	Rambocreativity, turn off secureboot and use a flash drive, that is the best option here

2018-08-10 10:02:36	@Mandevwin	Rambocreativity, do you have another computer?
2018-08-10 10:02:37	Rambocreativity	3 days ago I reinstalled windows.
2018-08-10 10:02:50	Rambocreativity	Yeah, how do you think I got the OS on the hard drive?

2018-08-10 10:03:15	@Mandevwin	is the other computer a desktop, or a, laptop?

2018-08-10 10:05:12	Voop	i would just troubleshoot the boot priority more
2018-08-10 10:05:33	@Mandevwin	the issue is either with the hdd, or the sata cable
2018-08-10 10:05:36	Rambocreativity	wait wait
2018-08-10 10:05:39	@Mandevwin	this is a hardware issue
2018-08-10 10:05:39	Rambocreativity	Laptops hdd?
2018-08-10 10:05:46	Voop	first id try to boot into the usb media on the computer you are on right now - make sure it works
2018-08-10 10:05:49	Rambocreativity	You want me to unscrew the laptop?
2018-08-10 10:06:04	@Mandevwin	i want you to remove your laptops hdd access panel

2018-08-10 10:06:11	Rambocreativity	OH
2018-08-10 10:06:13	@Mandevwin	and plug it into your desktop
2018-08-10 10:06:20	Rambocreativity	Yeah I tried that, don't know how to get it open.
2018-08-10 10:06:21	Rambocreativity	:P
2018-08-10 10:06:22	Voop	then id rearrange the boot priority 5 - 10 more times before giving up on that
2018-08-10 10:06:33	Rambocreativity	I spent 2 days without sleep figuring out how to open it without breaking it.

2018-08-10 10:06:47	@Mandevwin	scanning the hdd will tell us if that is the problem
2018-08-10 10:06:56	@Mandevwin	if it is, slam in a new hdd and all is good
2018-08-10 10:07:04	@Mandevwin	if not, replace sata cable
2018-08-10 10:07:10	Voop	how is it clear. he got windows and linux to boot from this media twice in the last 2 days
2018-08-10 10:07:30	@Mandevwin	because he is getting freezes after clean installing windows
2018-08-10 10:07:41	@Mandevwin	and the hdd isnt showing up in the device list in bios
2018-08-10 10:07:42	Rambocreativity	Just a black screen
2018-08-10 10:07:49	Rambocreativity	Freezes were what caused me to reinstall windows
2018-08-10 10:07:58	Rambocreativity	black screen is what's causing me to do it again
2018-08-10 10:08:08	@Mandevwin	if bios cant detect the hdd there is a hardware problem.
2018-08-10 10:08:28	Rambocreativity	This all started when it froze and all the audio cut out when I was playing siege.
2018-08-10 10:08:49	Rambocreativity	Then I restarted it yo fix.
2018-08-10 10:08:58	Rambocreativity	Got to login screen, froze again.
2018-08-10 10:09:03	Rambocreativity	Did another restart.
2018-08-10 10:09:13	Rambocreativity	Computer did an automatic diagnosis.
2018-08-10 10:09:21	Rambocreativity	It failed and sent me to recovery options.
2018-08-10 10:09:27	Rambocreativity	Tried to boot into safe mode.
2018-08-10 10:09:27	@Mandevwin	okay do whatever you want. Voop seems willing to assist
2018-08-10 10:09:32	Azzaman	hey, so I'm having this *really weird* issue with a website (cppreference.com, for what it's worth), where half of the text is being displayed in greek characters (not actually *IN* greek, just using the character set). Only seems to be affecting my laptop, and only this one website
2018-08-10 10:09:55	@Mandevwin	Azzaman, what browser? all of them?
2018-08-10 10:10:00	Rambocreativity	Worked, tried to take it out of safe mode to put it on safemode with networking
2018-08-10 10:10:06	Rambocreativity	and from there it just got worse and worse.
2018-08-10 10:10:20	Azzaman	well, that's the weird thing, it happens in chrome, and on the first load it happened in edge, but went away when reloading the page
2018-08-10 10:10:24	@Mandevwin	sounds like a hardware issue Rambocreativity but i dont know anything about computers
2018-08-10 10:10:31	Rambocreativity	OOF
2018-08-10 10:10:46	Rambocreativity	Only hardware issue I'm aware of is the screen.
2018-08-10 10:10:47	@Mandevwin	they made me op on here just for the hilarity of it
2018-08-10 10:11:11	Rambocreativity	There's a red and green like vertical on my screen at least an inch from each other.
2018-08-10 10:11:18	Rambocreativity	line
2018-08-10 10:11:18	@Mandevwin	Azzaman, are you using any vpn or proxy?
2018-08-10 10:11:20	Rambocreativity	I meant
2018-08-10 10:11:25	Voop	whats a computer
2018-08-10 10:11:30	Azzaman	Nope, not currently
2018-08-10 10:11:48	Azzaman	It seems to be something to do with the font, cos if I use the chrome inspector to change the css file, the issue goes away
2018-08-10 10:11:50	@Mandevwin	Rambocreativity, when does this issue occur? 
2018-08-10 10:12:06	Rambocreativity	Atleast a week ago by now.
2018-08-10 10:12:16	Rambocreativity	Started on friday last week.
2018-08-10 10:12:16	Voop	Rambocreativity: it would be nice if you had an extra laptop hdd
2018-08-10 10:12:27	Azzaman	tried restarting Chrome, to no avail
2018-08-10 10:12:30	Voop	but you probably arent a nerd who has 30 spares sitting around
2018-08-10 10:12:35	@Mandevwin	Rambocreativity, what i mean is does it occur during post and with the bios displayed?
2018-08-10 10:12:54	Voop	do you have a broken xbox 360 by chance
2018-08-10 10:12:57	Rambocreativity	The freezes and black screens?
2018-08-10 10:13:04	@Mandevwin	Rambocreativity, the lines
2018-08-10 10:13:06	Rambocreativity	Oh
2018-08-10 10:13:09	Rambocreativity	Always

2018-08-10 10:13:47	Rambocreativity	When did the lines occur?
2018-08-10 10:13:51	Rambocreativity	Uh
2018-08-10 10:13:54	@Mandevwin	Voop, running a smart test by pulling the hdd from the laptop seems MUCH easier than tearing apart an xbox 360 without the clip release tool
2018-08-10 10:13:57	Rambocreativity	A year and a half ago
2018-08-10 10:14:20	@Mandevwin	Voop, are you on crack?
2018-08-10 10:14:21	Rambocreativity	They just appeared, didn't know how to remove them, no one knew what I was talking about so I ignored them.
2018-08-10 10:14:37	Voop	well i have a pile of xbox 360 parts
2018-08-10 10:14:49	Voop	would be an easy option for someone who happens to have that
2018-08-10 10:14:57	Rambocreativity	They just stayed there only really bothering me when I'm watching porn or playing a game in fullscreen.
2018-08-10 10:15:04	@Mandevwin	who happens to even know how to tear down an xbox 360
2018-08-10 10:15:25	@Mandevwin	Rambocreativity, just run the smart test on the hdd using your desktop man
2018-08-10 10:15:25	Voop	i dont see how a diagnostic on the hdd is going to help
2018-08-10 10:15:29	Voop	but maybe it will
2018-08-10 10:15:34	@Mandevwin	it will tell us if the hdd is fucking BROKEN
2018-08-10 10:15:35	Rambocreativity	I've teared apart a xbox 360 WAY easier than I've got my laptop open.
2018-08-10 10:15:46	Voop	^
2018-08-10 10:15:50	Rambocreativity	The laptops or the external one?

2018-08-10 10:17:27	Rambocreativity	Wowie.

2018-08-10 10:18:18	Voop	mines still disassembled heh
2018-08-10 10:18:25	Azzaman	ugh, I'd rather avoid that if possible
2018-08-10 10:19:06	@Mandevwin	Azzaman, you can rename it chome.old and test. then go back in and restore the chrome.old to just chrome
2018-08-10 10:19:11	Voop	Rambocreativity: mine stopped booting completely after sitting not being used for a couple months
2018-08-10 10:19:39	@Mandevwin	Voop, Rambocreativity that is one easy fucking laptop to disassembly. but ill just butt out now
2018-08-10 10:19:40	Azzaman	actually, no, that won't help. Just remembered I'd tested it under a different chrome user, which uses different appdata
2018-08-10 10:19:44	Azzaman	issue still occurred

2018-08-10 10:40:31	@Mandevwin	IceMage, usually you need to press a button during boot to get to the boot selection menu
2018-08-10 10:40:32	John-1234	so to begin the process, where is the best way to start?
2018-08-10 10:40:39	@Mandevwin	IceMage, most times it is either f9 or f12

2018-08-10 10:41:50	@Virtual-Potato	well most computers that come with win10 have fastboot enabled by default
2018-08-10 10:41:54	@Mandevwin	true
2018-08-10 10:42:03	@Virtual-Potato	meaning it's impossible for you to get into bios without booting into windows first
2018-08-10 10:42:12	@Mandevwin	ice this a custom or prebuilt computer?
2018-08-10 10:42:16	Voop	just turn off fastboot
2018-08-10 10:42:22	Voop	doesnt require network
2018-08-10 10:42:32	@Virtual-Potato	you can't turn it off without going into bios first
2018-08-10 10:42:49	Voop	pretty sure you can
2018-08-10 10:42:56	@Mandevwin	you can just shift+click the restart button in windows 10, then it will boot to recovery, then you click "boot from usb"

2018-08-10 10:44:03	IceMage	It's an Alienware, might've selected some custom things when I ordered but i can't remember. So idk if you count that as custom or...but anyway, I'll try that shift-click method and see how it goes

2018-08-10 10:57:21	Buzzdude	ny suggestions?

2018-08-10 10:58:01	@Mandevwin	IceMage, while you have the yellow triangle, type in "ipconfig" and tell me what the ip address shows

2018-08-10 10:59:04	@Mandevwin	what i thought
2018-08-10 10:59:10	@Mandevwin	okay close cmd
2018-08-10 10:59:34	@Mandevwin	now open it again as admin (start menu, search for cmd, right click, run as administrator)
2018-08-10 10:59:34	IceMage	and then?
2018-08-10 11:00:19	@Mandevwin	after that type these three commands

2018-08-10 11:21:22	IceMage	Mandevwin Yes, my desktop which I am on now works fine.
2018-08-10 11:21:36	Voop	how loud is the buzz
2018-08-10 11:21:40	@Mandevwin	Buzzdude, yeah that wont work man, you have to have just a mic plugged into those
2018-08-10 11:21:53	IceMage	It's connected via ethernet and has no problems
2018-08-10 11:22:09	@Mandevwin	IceMage, do ipconfig. we need your gateway
2018-08-10 11:22:14	Buzzdude	i have a 4pin to 3pin splitter, is that not enough?
2018-08-10 11:22:22	@Mandevwin	Buzzdude, no
2018-08-10 11:22:44	Buzzdude	then how does anyone use a headset
2018-08-10 11:23:11	@Mandevwin	use a usb soundcard or get a headset that has both speaker input and mic output separate 
2018-08-10 11:23:15	davedave	Hello, I bought this Endoscope camera and it uses a program called viewplaycap. I've tried to make a video. I made a file named minicam.avi and tried to play it back but it doesn't want to play on anything
2018-08-10 11:23:24	IceMage	Mandevwin Ok that shows me what the gateway is, what do i do now?
2018-08-10 11:23:58	@Mandevwin	on laptop go to network and sharing center. change adapter settings. right click your wireless adapter, go to properties. select tcp/ipv4
2018-08-10 11:24:01	davedave	Now I've tried to use a video file converter and that doesn't add the file on it to change it
2018-08-10 11:24:29	Voop	davedave: vlc?
2018-08-10 11:24:35	Buzzdude	what? my little brother uses the exact same thing im trying to achieve and it works fine on his desktop. why would it be any different from me. I have multiple friends that also use a 4pin to 3 pin splitter which they then input into their desktop, no troubles.
2018-08-10 11:24:43	davedave	yes even that one doesn't play it
2018-08-10 11:24:56	@Mandevwin	Buzzdude, link me an example of the splitter
2018-08-10 11:25:03	Voop	the file is bunk then
2018-08-10 11:25:22	davedave	which means it's f'ed?
2018-08-10 11:25:31	@Mandevwin	davedave, how did you make the avi file
2018-08-10 11:25:34	Voop	probably a problem with the recording sofrware
2018-08-10 11:25:40	Voop	software

2018-08-10 11:26:22	davedave	Sadly I have to make a file directory to make a video with this endoscope
2018-08-10 11:27:09	IceMage	Mandevwin, I selected tcp/ipv4. now what?
2018-08-10 11:27:28	@Mandevwin	IceMage, we want to turn everything off auto. what was your gateway?
2018-08-10 11:27:55	davedave	which I did and called it minicam.avi. It doesn't want to play...Dunno what I did wrong, plus the only type that viewplaycap supports is avi! I think anyway
2018-08-10 11:28:25	IceMage	gateway when checked on desktop was 192.168.1.1
2018-08-10 11:28:30	Voop	what do you mean by create a file directory davedave
2018-08-10 11:28:33	davedave	what's even worse it that I have to size the file in MB's too
2018-08-10 11:28:43	@Mandevwin	davedave, please explain better, i have no idea how you made the video. did you just name it ".avi" hoping it would play, or does the software actually let you make videos through some sort of menu interface?
2018-08-10 11:29:21	davedave	before you can make a video, you need to make a file name and size of the file for the program to know where to save a video file on
2018-08-10 11:29:26	@Mandevwin	IceMage, okay gateway stys the same. set the ip address to 192.168.1.158 and the subnet to 255.255.255.0
2018-08-10 11:29:36	@Mandevwin	IceMage, change dns to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
2018-08-10 11:29:48	IceMage	already made the dns change. will try the other stuff now
2018-08-10 11:30:26	@Mandevwin	davedave, the size of the file should depend on the length and quality of the video. that's not something you "set"
2018-08-10 11:30:32	davedave	the program allows you to make video's but you 1st have to make the file for the program to store it on
2018-08-10 11:30:52	davedave	well, tell that to the idiot's who made that program lol
2018-08-10 11:31:07	davedave	ViewPlayCap <---look it up XD
2018-08-10 11:31:37	Voop	thats retarded
2018-08-10 11:31:58	davedave	well, some people think they can program something and guess what, they can't!
2018-08-10 11:32:10	@Mandevwin	IceMage, test and see if wifi works now
2018-08-10 11:32:24	Voop	is there any proof out there this program can make a watchable video

2018-08-10 11:35:15	IceMage	Mandevwin, changed those settings and saved it...connection problem remains the same it seems :/ It shouldn't require a reboot after fiddling with the settings right..?
2018-08-10 11:35:46	davedave	anyway, I can't recover this file at all. Correct?
2018-08-10 11:35:59	@Mandevwin	IceMage, reboot anyway.
2018-08-10 11:36:07	IceMage	alright brb...
2018-08-10 11:36:20	Buzzdude	Heya guys, whenever i input anything to my mic ports, my speakers buzz, and windows shows the mic port as buzzing, too. Any ideas to point me in the right direction on how to fix it?
2018-08-10 11:37:06	Voop	davedave: wow you literally specify what the file size will be...
2018-08-10 11:37:20	Voop	horrible software
2018-08-10 11:37:22	davedave	you have to lol
2018-08-10 11:37:36	davedave	I know :'(
2018-08-10 11:37:48	IceMage	That thing sounds sooo bad lol
2018-08-10 11:37:52	Voop	try setting a largeish file size and recording a short video
2018-08-10 11:38:28	IceMage	Mandevwin reboot complete, nothing has changed by the looks of it >_>
2018-08-10 11:38:32	davedave	I made it 2000 MB lol
2018-08-10 11:38:44	Voop	are you doing it like this guy does it
2018-08-10 11:38:49	@Mandevwin	go do an ipconfig and tell me what it says
2018-08-10 11:38:56	@Mandevwin	IceMage, pastebin the output
2018-08-10 11:39:00	Voop	clicking start capture icon etc
2018-08-10 11:39:07	davedave	the camera is only 5M so it can't be that the file size is to small
2018-08-10 11:39:08	@Mandevwin	IceMage, oh you cant
2018-08-10 11:39:19	@Mandevwin	IceMage, yeah hjust tell me what it says
2018-08-10 11:39:31	Voop	youre clicking start capture then stop capture
2018-08-10 11:39:33	davedave	yeah, I did it exactly like that guy did it lol
2018-08-10 11:39:47	davedave	just up'd the file to 2K
2018-08-10 11:40:09	IceMage	how strange...I checked the settings after rebooting and the IP address and stuff isn't saved o.o ...the DNS stuff is still set up tho
2018-08-10 11:40:15	Voop	my suggestion would be to find different software for it
2018-08-10 11:40:22	davedave	I guess I'll try to do the file fixer thingy, see if that doesn't fix the file
2018-08-10 11:40:35	@Mandevwin	IceMage, try changing it again. is it plugged into ethernet right now?
2018-08-10 11:40:44	davedave	yeah, I think that would be best but finding it!
2018-08-10 11:42:48	NotAName	It's always the DNS
2018-08-10 11:42:53	Buzzdude	noone has any idea? you guys are kinda my last hope :/
2018-08-10 11:43:25	Buzzdude	don't wanna spend more money on some kind of usb adaptor as i'd like to save on spendings
2018-08-10 11:44:08	NotAName	Can you swap it out for a USB mike
2018-08-10 11:44:28	NotAName	Buzzing is usually caused by grounding issues or a problem with your hardware
2018-08-10 11:44:40	@Mandevwin	Buzzdude, did you ever link your splitter?
2018-08-10 11:45:02	@Mandevwin	Buzzdude, does your headset work in your brother's splitter? or any of your friends that all use the same splitter?
2018-08-10 11:45:02	Buzzdude	i did, yeah
2018-08-10 11:45:26	davedave	Processing file : can't play!.avi
2018-08-10 11:45:27	davedave	Error: Input file is not an AVI file!
2018-08-10 11:45:38	Buzzdude	can't find the Id of my brothers splitter, seems to come with the headset
2018-08-10 11:45:49	davedave	lmfao this DivFix++ is saying it's not an avi file
2018-08-10 11:46:03	@Mandevwin	Buzzdude, but does yours work with it?
2018-08-10 11:46:10	Buzzdude	no
2018-08-10 11:46:14	Buzzdude	i've tried both our splitters
2018-08-10 11:46:27	Buzzdude	i've also tried putting in purely the splitter, which causes the same buzzing
2018-08-10 11:46:38	NotAName	Sounds like the port's got the problem
2018-08-10 11:46:50	Buzzdude	the exact same thing happens in front and back port
2018-08-10 11:46:59	@Mandevwin	and on other computers, you said?
2018-08-10 11:47:06	@Mandevwin	but not your brothers for some reason
2018-08-10 11:47:10	Buzzdude	yup, same story on my parents desktop, but not on my laptops
2018-08-10 11:47:46	Buzzdude	my brother went on vacation earlier today so i cant access his desktop im afraid
2018-08-10 11:47:47	@Mandevwin	does your headset work fine in a splitter on your brothers computer?
2018-08-10 11:47:50	@Mandevwin	ah
2018-08-10 11:47:57	IceMage	Wow I think it's actually working on Wi-fi now! Gonna reboot again and test it...unrelated issue tho, my i'm in IST (irish summer time) because of DST but for some reason the clock on my laptop is suddenly become 1hr behind...wtf is up with that?
2018-08-10 11:48:42	@Mandevwin	IceMage, network issue trigegred it. just change it manually
2018-08-10 11:50:33	davedave	might striping index on the file help solve the problem?
2018-08-10 11:51:03	Buzzdude	so the only solution would be to buy a audio-usb adapter? :/ seems dumb, why even offer a mic entrance in that case
2018-08-10 11:51:08	@Mandevwin	no it is not encoded for avi
2018-08-10 11:51:31	@Mandevwin	Buzzdude, sounds like a very cheap adapter to me
2018-08-10 11:51:50	@Mandevwin	Buzzdude, or you are using it wrong. 
2018-08-10 11:51:53	@Mandevwin	or something
2018-08-10 11:51:55	davedave	damn, well that's super f'ed since the program only picks AVI file set ups for you lol
2018-08-10 11:52:07	Buzzdude	i currently have no adapter, and am simply using the mic entrance my mobo provides
2018-08-10 11:52:14	@Mandevwin	davedave, contact the software's support team
2018-08-10 11:52:25	Voop	Mandevwin: lol
2018-08-10 11:52:30	Buzzdude	MSI Z370 Gaming Plus is the mobo

2018-08-10 11:54:44	@Mandevwin	where do you get all this money for all your gaming shit anyway?
2018-08-10 11:54:48	Buzzdude	but like i said, the issue occurs regardless of what kind of thing goes in
2018-08-10 11:55:00	Buzzdude	stinger is brother's
2018-08-10 11:55:08	@Mandevwin	multiple laptops, nice headsets, nice desktops. you gamer kids seem to have it made
2018-08-10 11:55:17	Buzzdude	haha, yeah i guess so
2018-08-10 11:55:27	Buzzdude	did pay for most of it myself, but haven't had a job in a while
2018-08-10 11:55:43	Buzzdude	single laptop though
2018-08-10 11:56:25	@Mandevwin	Buzzdude, what is wrong with the usb sound card that came with the hyperxcloud 2?
2018-08-10 11:56:45	Buzzdude	connection keeps breaking, the usb sound card that came with it broke
2018-08-10 11:56:59	Buzzdude	this is the 2nd time that happened so i wanted to switch over to a mic cable
2018-08-10 11:57:32	@Mandevwin	apparently your splitters suck too
2018-08-10 11:58:31	Buzzdude	well its cheap, so i didn't expect much of it untill i could buy a more permanent one
2018-08-10 11:58:41	@Mandevwin	if i were you, id just buy a decent headset instead of that one
2018-08-10 11:58:50	@Mandevwin	hyperx is terrible
2018-08-10 11:59:07	Buzzdude	this one actually got recommended to me because it has a mic built in and the audio quality is good
2018-08-10 11:59:24	Buzzdude	"one of the few gaming headsets that provides quality audio"
2018-08-10 11:59:24	@Mandevwin	is it under warranty?
2018-08-10 11:59:29	Buzzdude	nope
2018-08-10 11:59:33	@Mandevwin	oh whatever, that is bs
2018-08-10 11:59:42	Buzzdude	have had it for 2 years now
2018-08-10 11:59:50	@Mandevwin	"gaming headsets" and "quality audio" dont go together
2018-08-10 12:00:02	@Mandevwin	get a regular headset instead
2018-08-10 12:00:10	@Mandevwin	why do you need one marketed at gamers
2018-08-10 12:00:18	IceMage	Woot, restarted laptop and the connection still seems to work fine :D Fingers crossed that it will stay working now :)
2018-08-10 12:00:21	Buzzdude	i wanted a heatset with a mic on it
2018-08-10 12:00:30	Buzzdude	with nice quality audio
2018-08-10 12:00:33	Buzzdude	this seemed like a good fit
2018-08-10 12:00:46	Buzzdude	but its besides the point of the fix to buy a new one, the headset itself works
2018-08-10 12:01:01	@Mandevwin	IceMage, it will for now, that is more of a band-aid fix. not sure why you arent getting serverd by dhcp, if you want a perma fix, id probably reset your router to factory default
2018-08-10 12:01:14	@Mandevwin	Buzzdude, is it under warranty?

2018-08-10 14:21:29	@Donjuanal	or wipe it with a magnet

2018-08-10 15:09:46	kindaskingg	yea... well *that* issue is the standard reply, right?  I mean troubleshooting can be fun too.  But, any computer problem in the history of computer problems can *ALWAYS* be answered with, "you should have a backup...either restore that or reinstall".  But I understand that is not something you get

2018-08-10 15:14:15	kindaskingg	I come to this channel fairly often... sometimes I try to help... sometimes I ask questions myself.  I gotta say that 80%+ of what I see is totally unhelpful advise of "Just reinstall...".  I mean... why even comment.  Everyone knows that reinstall will fix everything....of course.  Hey!  I need an oil change... well...buy a new car.  haha
2018-08-10 15:14:55	+theGerman	nah the approriate answer for I need an oil change would be then change the oil

2018-08-10 16:34:32	moon	So I've done a lot of testing, and I feel like something is blocking the ethernet connection from my laptop. I've tried connecting the ethernet cable from the ethernet port, through a 3.0 usb adapter, a 2.0 usb adapter, and a usb c adapter. All returned the same results, showing "unidentified network" with "no internet", even though I verified that
2018-08-10 16:34:32	moon	 the ethernet cable is functional, and so are the adapters. Anything I can do to troubleshoot what's wrong?

I can connect wireless no problem, but I can't connect with Ethernet. I have a solid orange light next to the Ethernet port on my motherboard. How can I remove solid orange light next

2018-08-10 18:00:38	Klemet	Hello, everyone. I'm having a problem of CPU throttling that seems to be linked to the battery/alimentation of my laptop (Asus ROG G752VM). The CPU is stuck at a frequency of 0.78GhZ, when the laptop is plugged-in or not. Battery is stuck at a certain percentage. When re-plugued, the throttles goes of for a few seconds, then comes back. Using Throt
2018-08-10 18:00:38	Klemet	tleStop to deactivate the BD PROCHOT options seems to lift it, and get the frequency running again. However, the CPU usage cannot get past 40%, even when using ThrottleStop, and puggling/unplugging have no effect anymore. I'm at a loss there; does anyone have an advice ?

2018-08-10 18:07:14	@whitewolf	it's likely sleeping because the battery is reaching its critical alarm
2018-08-10 18:07:31	Klemet	I see; The battery is more than 60% though
2018-08-10 18:07:37	Klemet	But it could be a voltage problem, I imagine.

2018-08-10 18:07:52	Klemet	Yet, on this model, the battery is internal :(. This isn't going to be a walk in the park.
2018-08-10 18:08:15	Klemet	68% charged, at the moment
2018-08-10 18:08:26	Klemet	But unmoving.

2018-08-10 20:08:44	@whitewolf	i see a few opinions about this online
2018-08-10 20:09:00	@whitewolf	i would try resetting your UEFI to defaults and seeing if that fixes things
2018-08-10 20:09:54	@whitewolf	a few theories i found: a flaw in the z170 chipset leads to part of it browning out, which would mimic psu issues -- people have tried about a 6% auto-overclock or a slight increase in voltages until the machine was stable
2018-08-10 20:10:13	@whitewolf	they also note that the usb3 driver on that board might be bonkers, so disabling the onboard usb3 and trying might be worth some weight

2018-08-10 20:14:41	cutreddd	A friend of mine also said that it could have something to do with nvidia drivers since there were no issues with the amd cards for atleast the 13 days I was using it
2018-08-10 20:14:59	@whitewolf	i had considered that but it's unlikely
2018-08-10 20:15:14	@whitewolf	it's more likely the older AMD card pulls considerably less power
2018-08-10 20:15:20	@whitewolf	is the main factor

2018-08-10 23:54:08	fluxtroid	@deww Yes other games do use my GPU too. At the moment my best guess is that it's coil whine (I had a little help from the Reddit sub).
2018-08-11 00:00:18	fluxtroid	deww I have just watched a few videos of coil whine and mine is nothing like it. Mine is more like an interference of a phone around a stereo (not the same, but more similar). If it helps, the noise actually sort of flows with when the game is loading stuff. So going from the menu to in game will actually cause it to stop for a split second

2018-08-11 00:07:15	fluxtroid	I am using front-panel sound (because it's "pure" compared to the IO sound (has fancy filters)). I have studio headphones so I need an untouched sound source and the front IO is best for this. Btw, moving my headphones to the rear IO actually removes the sound. Idk if this is because it's not affected by the interference or because it filters it ou

2018-08-11 08:23:07	Voop	if i know what youre talking about i can help
2018-08-11 08:23:43	Arvid	about it's about nvidia (geforce experience)

2018-08-11 08:24:43	Arvid	yeah
2018-08-11 08:24:50	Voop	when do you get that error
2018-08-11 08:25:06	Arvid	when I try to launch it
2018-08-11 08:25:16	Arvid	did a clean win 10 last night
2018-08-11 08:25:22	Arvid	and never got it to work
2018-08-11 08:25:34	Voop	probably driver related
2018-08-11 08:25:39	Arvid	yeah
2018-08-11 08:25:53	Voop	win10 is usually good about drivers
2018-08-11 08:26:06	Voop	but nvidia has all of them on their website
2018-08-11 08:26:14	Voop	go there, select your gpu
2018-08-11 08:26:29	Arvid	yeah, i´w done that
2018-08-11 08:26:42	Arvid	and I did a Display Driver Uninstaller
2018-08-11 08:26:44	Arvid	as well
2018-08-11 08:26:54	Arvid	( it removes everything)

2018-08-11 08:27:27	Arvid	just fine
2018-08-11 08:27:38	Voop	its just geforce experience

2018-08-11 08:28:03	Arvid	its a lot of stuff on youtube about it. but nothing of that works
2018-08-11 08:28:05	Voop	i assume youve tried uninstalling and reinstalling
2018-08-11 08:28:12	Arvid	yeah

2018-08-11 08:28:40	@PipeItToDevNull	what error, and why is it needed 
2018-08-11 08:29:07	Voop	its needed to change the blink speed of the LEDS obviously
2018-08-11 08:30:23	Arvid	?

2018-08-11 08:31:50	Voop	you are probably missing a driver

2018-08-11 08:44:20	SuperGunnar	And the sound disappears if I turn of the laptop or just closes the screen (sleep mode I guess?). Then I have to reinstall, and then I got to reboot. And then it works
2018-08-11 08:44:58	Voop	are you sure its the correct driver
2018-08-11 08:46:08	SuperGunnar	Pretty sure. I have tried the driver that came with the computer, I have tried to update it in Windows updater, I have tried to remove it all together and then getting it back from Windows updater and I have tried installing it from their site

2018-08-11 08:51:45	badclusters	Hi gang, wondering if anyone could help me diagnose a possible hard drive failure. Lenovo y580 with hdd+ssd cache drive. Had some general slowness (granted, no reformat in 6 years) and ran tools like gsmartcontrol/crystaldiskinfo. All say OK. Ran chkdsk: said most of the hdd was bad clusters, disk now has 1gb free after running.
2018-08-11 08:53:01	@PipeItToDevNull	lol
2018-08-11 08:53:06	Voop	what do you mean diagnose
2018-08-11 08:53:16	@PipeItToDevNull	Is that the NTFS or disk it self that is down to 1GB 
2018-08-11 08:53:58	SuperGunnar	https://db.tt/zkv8bCx3mZ - here's the user manual for my computer if that is any help
2018-08-11 08:53:58	badclusters	It shows 1.9GB free of 917GB but had somewhere in the range of 250gb free prior to running chkdsk

2018-08-11 10:41:45	CoJaBo	Philmoilbout: Verify that, then maybe try swapping the modules (which will reseat them in the process)
2018-08-11 10:42:05	CoJaBo	Also, make sure they're installed into the correct sockets, as some mobos are picky about that
2018-08-11 10:42:15	Philmoilbout	Ohh thanks ! pretty sure i'm running on 64bits
2018-08-11 10:42:23	Philmoilbout	i'll try to switch them
2018-08-11 10:43:28	Philmoilbout	Is it possible 1 of them stoped working after a certains time ?
2018-08-11 10:44:10	CoJaBo	Possible, but rare. Was it after newly upgrade, or did it work before?
2018-08-11 10:44:51	Philmoilbout	i just realize after some years using the pc, i always taught i had 8 gb

2018-08-11 10:46:17	CoJaBo	Yeh, I have no idea what that tool is
2018-08-11 10:46:27	CoJaBo	You can try the speccy thing

2018-08-11 11:05:51	JJTumelty	Hi, All. Wondering if anybody can help me? I recently got an HP ProDesk 600 G2 Mini and am looking to upgrade its 2.5" HDD with a 4TB 2.5" HDD (Seagate BarraCuda 4 TB 2.5 Inch Internal Hard Drive). There seems to be quite a bit of discrepancy on whether this is an internal or external drive? Will I be able to do a clone and a straight swap or will 
2018-08-11 11:05:51	JJTumelty	I need some sort of caddy/enclosure for it? Any help/advice would be wonderful. Cheers. Josh. :)
2018-08-11 11:06:32	Voop	it has internal in the name
2018-08-11 11:07:14	JJTumelty	It does, yes, but in the Amazon item description it says "Rock-solid reliability built on over 20 years of BarraCuda innovation , for external enclosure only"
2018-08-11 11:08:29	@electricbear	link the drive

2018-08-11 11:10:08	@electricbear	they are saying you can buy an enclosure for it
2018-08-11 11:10:11	Voop	i see zero reason why that would be external use only
2018-08-11 11:10:15	@electricbear	but it's definitely a normal drive
2018-08-11 11:10:53	JJTumelty	So you're pretty confident that I will be able to use it as my primary internal drive?
2018-08-11 11:11:02	Voop	i am
2018-08-11 11:11:14	@electricbear	people are using it for their PS4 if you read comments
2018-08-11 11:12:01	JJTumelty	I saw that but those were for 2TB and lower and those don't say the bit about "for external enclosure only"
2018-08-11 11:13:05	@electricbear	you might be right
2018-08-11 11:13:12	@electricbear	but i cant see how it would be for external only
2018-08-11 11:13:58	JJTumelty	I might just have to be patient and wait til Monday to contact Seagate themselves :/ It's a tricky one...
2018-08-11 11:14:18	@electricbear	just order a different 4tb drive
2018-08-11 11:14:40	@electricbear	also why not an SSD?

2018-08-11 11:15:41	JJTumelty	I'm mainly looking for storage space and my job definitely doesn't pay well enough for a 4TB SSD! I could look for a different 4TB drive though
2018-08-11 11:16:03	@electricbear	i would buy an SSD and keep the 2TB as storage
2018-08-11 11:16:11	@electricbear	do you really need more than 2.5 TB?
2018-08-11 11:17:13	Voop	there are cheaper ones
2018-08-11 11:17:53	Voop	actually maybe not
2018-08-11 11:20:08	Voop	electricbear: why SSD? why not 4tb m.2 based storage
2018-08-11 11:20:21	JJTumelty	I guess 2TB would suffice, but still an SSD that size would be pretty costly, I could probably go for the 2TB 2.5" Seagate one and play it safe but the 4TB is a good deal (if it works!)
2018-08-11 11:20:50	@electricbear	Voop, assumed he didnt have that connection
2018-08-11 11:20:58	Voop	well why would it be for external enclosure only
2018-08-11 11:21:12	Voop	i cant think of a reason it would work fine via usb but not via sata
2018-08-11 11:22:10	JJTumelty	I've not a clue. Also if it were going through the enclosure, would that limit it to the speed of the USB?
2018-08-11 11:22:26	Voop	yes
2018-08-11 11:22:47	@electricbear	USB 3 is plenty fast
2018-08-11 11:24:04	JJTumelty	Yeah? In that case would it be wise to buy a 4TB portable HDD with USB 3.0? I've seen them cheaper and if 3.0 runs at a decent speed I guess I could do that?

2018-08-11 11:24:43	@electricbear	SSD is a lot faster than an HDD
2018-08-11 11:24:48	@electricbear	so I still think you should get that
2018-08-11 11:25:03	@electricbear	but having 6TB of storage would work I guess
2018-08-11 11:26:44	JJTumelty	2TB SSD would set be back around £500, that's a little out of my price range, unfortunately. I do see your point though, ideally I would get an SSD but due to my financial limitations I'd dip out on storage space if I were to get one.

2018-08-11 11:27:25	@electricbear	put 2TB drive in an enclosure
2018-08-11 11:27:26	Voop	if speed isnt an issue
2018-08-11 11:27:35	@electricbear	then you have 2.5 TB
2018-08-11 11:28:16	Voop	yeah ideally you want your os and applications on an ssd
2018-08-11 11:28:50	@electricbear	if you are running out of space after 2TB, then I question what you are doing
2018-08-11 11:29:22	Voop	its easy to max out 2tb
2018-08-11 11:29:45	Voop	downloading blu rays mostly
2018-08-11 11:29:56	Voop	and some large vidiya games
2018-08-11 11:30:00	JJTumelty	That's a good point. I'll take a look and discuss with the family (shared PC...) to see what we want to go for. 2TB should be enough but I was hoping to keep it going for a long time so didn't want to have to be spending out in the next couple years, if that makes sense?
2018-08-11 11:31:53	@electricbear	the optimal decision depends on what you need
2018-08-11 11:33:44	JJTumelty	I guess so, I'll have a bit of a think and see what else is on the market. Has been great talking to you both though, cheers for the advice. Have a nice evening (or whatever it is where you are in the world). :)
2018-08-11 11:34:18	Voop	theres nothing in the q&a about the enclosure only comment
2018-08-11 11:34:33	Voop	lots of people using them for ps4's and no one seems to be complaining
2018-08-11 11:36:23	@electricbear	figure out how much space you actually need JJTumelty 
2018-08-11 11:36:47	Voop	id go with the one you linked if thats what you want
2018-08-11 11:36:58	@electricbear	if you can handle less than 2.5TB, put the 2TB drive in an enclosure and use a 500GB ssd as your main drive
2018-08-11 11:37:03	Voop	90+% chance it works fine, if not just send it back
2018-08-11 11:37:38	JJTumelty	That was my thought, Voop, but I thought if I plugged it in they may not accept returns.
2018-08-11 11:38:00	@electricbear	they always accept returns. it's amazon
2018-08-11 11:38:49	Voop	if you plug it in and it doesnt work then theres no evidence you plugged it in
2018-08-11 11:38:59	Voop	as you wont be able to format it or put anything on it
2018-08-11 11:39:36	JJTumelty	I guess I thought that if the anti-static bag had been opened they wouldn't accept it?
2018-08-11 11:39:51	Voop	amazon will generally accept any return
2018-08-11 11:40:09	Voop	you could poop on the hdd and theyd still refund you
2018-08-11 11:40:15	@electricbear	^
2018-08-11 11:42:58	Voop	the last time i had to return something they said i had to pay like $6 shipping and wouldnt get the refund until they had the item back
2018-08-11 11:43:14	Voop	i called and just asked if i could get the money now as i was strapped for cash
2018-08-11 11:43:29	Voop	they gave me the refund instantly and waived the shipping cost
2018-08-11 11:43:36	JJTumelty	Oh wow, that's good of them
2018-08-11 11:44:05	JJTumelty	I just sent back the 3.5" 4TB HDD I ordered by accident... it's the same size as the PC I was going to put it in :D
2018-08-11 11:45:45	Voop	so you want a pc the size of a streaming box with 4tb of storage
2018-08-11 11:49:13	JJTumelty	Well that was the plan, I got the PC from a friend as he wasn't using it anymore. I just thought it was pretty neat being so small
2018-08-11 11:49:55	JJTumelty	Anyways, I've gotta run, food is here. Thanks for the chat and advice. Au revoir

2018-08-11 16:39:06	Intypical	I just built a new pc except the CPU, RAM, and HDD. I tried to turn on the pc to test fans and see if connections are good, but it simply wont turn on, no indicators leds or beep codes. However, the GPU light is on, but no fans are spinning, not even the PSU fans. I tried to jumpstart the pc through the two power connector pins and a screwdriver, h
2018-08-11 16:39:06	Intypical	owever that does nothing either. The mobo is a Gigabyte AB350m -DS3h, PSU is a Thermaltake Smart RGB 700w, and GPU is a ASUS GTX 1060 Turbo 6G
2018-08-11 16:39:37	@whitewolf	well, time to rebuild the machine 
2018-08-11 16:39:47	Intypical	?
2018-08-11 16:39:50	@whitewolf	make sure you plugged in both the 12V CPU power and the 24 pin motherboard connector
2018-08-11 16:40:01	@whitewolf	remove everything not necessary to boot, all drives etc
2018-08-11 16:40:04	Kds15	Switch on PSU is on the correct setting, yes?
2018-08-11 16:40:15	Intypical	Yes

2018-08-11 16:40:57	Kds15	is there an orange switch on the PSU?

2018-08-11 16:41:33	Kds15	Yeah but i figured it wouldnt hurt to ask
2018-08-11 16:41:57	Intypical	ythe GPU light only turns on when its plugged into the pci slot
2018-08-11 16:42:01	Intypical	so idk if mobo is problem
2018-08-11 16:42:08	ThatBroadcasterG	@whitewolf The most obvious symptom is that Youtube videos play very jittery

2018-08-11 16:43:24	Intypical	i did
2018-08-11 16:43:32	Intypical	i put it on the cardboard mobo box

2018-08-11 16:44:13	Intypical	is the cpu power the 4+4 pin
2018-08-11 16:44:44	Kds15	Maybe try reseating the RAM if nothing else?

2018-08-11 17:49:50	kimjongun	I'm not sure where to start but I'll tell you what happens.
2018-08-11 17:50:01	kimjongun	So basically when my laptop loses all its battery, it loses all the settings. Including the fact that I disabled "Secure Boot".
2018-08-11 17:50:19	kimjongun	When "Secure Boot" is enabled, it goes to GRUB and lets me choose the OS.
2018-08-11 17:50:51	kimjongun	It used to be that Windows was preinstalled.
2018-08-11 17:51:28	kimjongun	On top of that, I have a hardware problem with my laptop. When I switch on the computer, the keyboard seems to think I'm holding down V.
2018-08-11 17:51:45	kimjongun	Unless I hit V or B hard enough. Then it stops.

2018-08-11 18:07:50	kimjongun	I only get this problem when it's dead for like more than an hour.
2018-08-11 18:08:02	kimjongun	If it does in front of my face, I charge it immediately and don't get the problem.
2018-08-11 18:08:34	@Swede	the cmos battery is typically a 2032 coin cell. in laptops it's sometimes soldered in, often in a plastic wrap
2018-08-11 18:08:49	@Swede	and hard to get to
2018-08-11 18:08:52	@PipeItToDevNull	I see them in a plastic wrap in a plug 
2018-08-11 18:09:05	@PipeItToDevNull	Why are you disabling secure boot?
2018-08-11 18:09:36	kimjongun	I probably messed up the booting mechanism since I changed from Windows to Dual-Boot Ubuntu/Windows to just Ubuntu.
2018-08-11 18:10:31	@PipeItToDevNull	Ubuntu is secure boot certified (they paid MS) since 14
2018-08-11 18:10:32	kimjongun	And then it wouldn't boot correctly in Secure Boot because I might have messed up some stuff.
2018-08-11 18:11:14	kimjongun	Sorry, after Ubuntu, I dual booted Ubuntu / ArchLinux and I'm using Arch now mainly.
2018-08-11 18:11:27	@PipeItToDevNull	Arch wont be secure boot certified 
2018-08-11 18:11:35	kimjongun	Okay. So that's it I guess.
2018-08-11 18:11:47	kimjongun	Then I'll always have to disable it, then?
2018-08-11 18:13:11	@PipeItToDevNull	yes 
2018-08-11 18:13:30	@PipeItToDevNull	script it to power off after X hours of sleep 
2018-08-11 18:13:36	@PipeItToDevNull	Also, linux sucks at sleeping 
2018-08-11 18:13:44	@PipeItToDevNull	Anything modern should be SSD and have longer resumes than boots 
2018-08-11 18:14:15	kimjongun	Yeah. This laptop is quite old. 2013

2018-08-11 23:38:24	Cypher-Punk	This is really odd. I've been having trouble with my new Seagate external HDD. It is a partitionless encrypted drive (via Veracrypt) and it would transfer fine for a while, then drop down to under 1 megabyte per second and never come back up. After completely reformatting and reencrypting the drive it appears to be going fine now..
2018-08-11 23:38:53	Cypher-Punk	I'm debating on returning it, because i have a 30 day return window
2018-08-11 23:41:12	Cypher-Punk	the veracrypt volume is formatted as NTFS, and I lost power one day during a file transfer. I suspect that corrupted the encryption in some way somehow, in turn causing those issues. I'm paranoid about it now.
2018-08-12 00:06:39	@PipeItToDevNull	Well yeah its unstable as hell 
2018-08-12 00:06:51	@PipeItToDevNull	It has no tables or partitions 
2018-08-12 00:07:45	@PipeItToDevNull	Also, I would do exfat, NTFS feels funny 
2018-08-12 00:09:38	Cypher-Punk	Yeah, maybe it's just better to do an encrypted partition, even though having two drive letters for one drive rubs me the wrong way in Windows.
2018-08-12 00:10:30	@PipeItToDevNull	ive only seen windows work well with bitlocker 
2018-08-12 00:10:43	@PipeItToDevNull	My encryption would open as its own file manager 
2018-08-12 00:11:58	Cypher-Punk	with an encrypted partition, upon plugging it in to windows it would assign it a drive letter, then say it needs to be formatted to be used, which is understandable because it's just jibberish to windows. then when i decrypt it, it adds a second drive to my drive list.
2018-08-12 00:12:18	Cypher-Punk	asking to format and having 2 drive letters always bugged me for some reason
2018-08-12 00:12:33	Cypher-Punk	i'm glad linux doesn't do that
2018-08-12 00:12:54	@PipeItToDevNull	why not just use a container 
2018-08-12 00:14:15	Cypher-Punk	Tried it before, it was kinda annoying having a 5tb file containing all the other files, idk
2018-08-12 00:14:35	Cypher-Punk	formatting the whole partition was the lesser of two evils for me
2018-08-12 00:14:42	Cypher-Punk	er encrypting* not formating
2018-08-12 00:15:05	@PipeItToDevNull	Why is 5TB of data moving between two machines 
2018-08-12 00:15:09	@PipeItToDevNull	on a HDD 
2018-08-12 00:15:29	Cypher-Punk	the contain has to be 5tb to hold the 5tb of data...
2018-08-12 00:15:32	Cypher-Punk	container*
2018-08-12 00:15:44	@PipeItToDevNull	that wasnt the question 
2018-08-12 00:16:01	@PipeItToDevNull	I am wondering if you can have a simpler solution 
2018-08-12 00:16:09	@PipeItToDevNull	Big-Data is shitty on anything that is moved 
2018-08-12 00:16:24	Cypher-Punk	I'm not sure what you mean by moving between two machines
2018-08-12 00:17:04	@PipeItToDevNull	you mount a 5TB disk on Windows and Linux 
2018-08-12 00:17:47	Cypher-Punk	I store everything on it.
2018-08-12 00:18:49	@PipeItToDevNull	And back it up to where?
2018-08-12 00:18:58	@PipeItToDevNull	Another encrypted disk?
2018-08-12 00:19:17	Cypher-Punk	That was the plan. I bought two Seagate 8tb external HDDs
2018-08-12 00:19:28	Cypher-Punk	i was going to keep the data on them the same.
2018-08-12 00:19:58	Cypher-Punk	currently I have only one 6tb Western Digital external HDD, so my data wasn't even backed up, simply stored.
2018-08-12 00:20:01	@PipeItToDevNull	Huge disks give me fits 
2018-08-12 00:20:22	Cypher-Punk	I mean before I bought the 8tb ones I only had the 6tb
2018-08-12 00:21:48	@PipeItToDevNull	if I had big data I would use a NAS RAID 
2018-08-12 00:22:00	@PipeItToDevNull	Then send shit to the cloud 
2018-08-12 00:22:17	Cypher-Punk	meh, I just call it "my own cloud".
2018-08-12 00:25:18	@PipeItToDevNull	 Ijust bought a T710 today, I am putting server 2019 on it right now 
2018-08-12 00:25:25	@PipeItToDevNull	My network is going to be dope
2018-08-12 00:25:41	@PipeItToDevNull	Probably just going to do bitlocker through the AD for windows boxes 
2018-08-12 00:26:11	@PipeItToDevNull	I dont know if LUKS on the storage device, or OS encryptions is better 
2018-08-12 00:26:18	Cypher-Punk	Bitlocker being closed source makes me paranoid.
2018-08-12 00:26:50	@PipeItToDevNull	cause the NSA putting backdoors in it?

2018-08-12 00:52:00	jackdog	the actual media creation tool
2018-08-12 00:52:04	jackdog	i didnt copy pase the file

2018-08-12 01:03:41	@PipeItToDevNull	the big red letters says it needs a BIOS update 
2018-08-12 01:04:11	jackdog	this worked before tho
2018-08-12 01:04:13	Cypher-Punk	Yeah I spotted that as well. It said some MOBOs may need to have th BIOS updated before using that CPU, but afterwards the CPU would be compatible.
2018-08-12 01:04:32	@PipeItToDevNull	jackdog, you said this was a new machine 
2018-08-12 01:04:36	jackdog	yeah
2018-08-12 01:04:40	jackdog	i copied my friend's specs
2018-08-12 01:04:56	@PipeItToDevNull	his may have been updated 
2018-08-12 01:04:57	Cypher-Punk	jackdog: perhaps his motherboard came with the newer BIOS version?
2018-08-12 01:05:09	jackdog	he had an older mother board
2018-08-12 01:05:25	jackdog	idk man
2018-08-12 01:05:28	jackdog	the driver thingy
2018-08-12 01:05:32	jackdog	wait let me try swithc the usb port
2018-08-12 01:05:34	jackdog	one sec
2018-08-12 01:05:40	@PipeItToDevNull	That isnt the issue 
2018-08-12 01:05:42	randondude	is this a windows bug?
2018-08-12 01:05:46	@PipeItToDevNull	It isnt talking about install media

2018-08-12 01:05:57	jackdog	let me try switch the usb
2018-08-12 01:06:07	jackdog	no its asking the usb is not plugged in
2018-08-12 01:06:14	jackdog	like the media isnt detected
2018-08-12 01:06:18	@PipeItToDevNull	randondude, is what a bug 
2018-08-12 01:06:24	@PipeItToDevNull	jackdog, no, it isnt 
2018-08-12 01:06:42	Cypher-Punk	randondude: When installing Windows 10 on my newly built PC, he gets a "media driver your computer needs is missing" error.
2018-08-12 01:06:52	Cypher-Punk	on his* newly built PC
2018-08-12 01:06:53	jackdog	even tho the usb is plugged in
2018-08-12 01:06:56	Cypher-Punk	sorry, I'm tired
2018-08-12 01:07:03	randondude	but desc. really seems swicthed!
2018-08-12 01:07:11	@PipeItToDevNull	randondude, no 
2018-08-12 01:07:16	@PipeItToDevNull	that is normal and accurate 
2018-08-12 01:07:19	randondude	does not make sense
2018-08-12 01:07:31	@PipeItToDevNull	How?
2018-08-12 01:07:38	jackdog	what is happening
2018-08-12 01:07:39	@PipeItToDevNull	If you are on a public network, you should hide 
2018-08-12 01:07:46	@PipeItToDevNull	if you are at home, you should be able to see shit 
2018-08-12 01:08:18	randondude	what is safer?
2018-08-12 01:08:48	randondude	which setting is safer to use?
2018-08-12 01:09:03	randondude	I have a cozy litte room
2018-08-12 01:09:03	Cypher-Punk	public hides you from others on your network
2018-08-12 01:09:06	@PipeItToDevNull	Public, if you want to make it a binary choice 
2018-08-12 01:09:24	jackdog	so do i need to do something in my bios?
2018-08-12 01:09:25	Cypher-Punk	but if it's your home network, it can be convenient to set it so you can see other devices, such as printers
2018-08-12 01:09:39	@PipeItToDevNull	jackdog, I would see what version the BIOS is 
2018-08-12 01:09:48	jackdog	how to check
2018-08-12 01:09:53	jackdog	oh wait lol et me go to the bios one sec
2018-08-12 01:09:56	@PipeItToDevNull	it will be in BIOS somewhere 
2018-08-12 01:10:00	Cypher-Punk	lol
2018-08-12 01:10:10	randondude	but public sounds not private and private sounds like more public
2018-08-12 01:10:17	randondude	lol
2018-08-12 01:10:39	Cypher-Punk	it's referring to if it's a home network (private)
2018-08-12 01:10:52	@PipeItToDevNull	What?
2018-08-12 01:10:52	jackdog	where is ti in the bios
2018-08-12 01:10:58	jackdog	oh here
2018-08-12 01:11:00	jackdog	bios version
2018-08-12 01:11:01	jackdog	F20
2018-08-12 01:11:02	@PipeItToDevNull	It is the network, not your machine 
2018-08-12 01:11:10	@PipeItToDevNull	A public network, not a public machine 
2018-08-12 01:11:15	jackdog	what?
2018-08-12 01:11:21	jackdog	how did my network get in here
2018-08-12 01:11:23	@PipeItToDevNull	jackdog, you need F21 apparently 
2018-08-12 01:11:30	jackdog	how do you upgrade to f21
2018-08-12 01:11:32	Cypher-Punk	jackdog: two conversations going at once lol
2018-08-12 01:11:44	jackdog	wait let me ask my friend my what version his mobo is
2018-08-12 01:11:45	jackdog	brb

2018-08-12 01:12:47	Cypher-Punk	I'm not 100% sure who you'd go to for a BIOS update on a built PC though
2018-08-12 01:12:57	jackdog	oh wait this may be the thing
2018-08-12 01:12:58	Cypher-Punk	the MOBO company website iguess?

2018-08-12 01:20:05	jackdog	wait its the mobo's problem?
2018-08-12 01:20:07	@PipeItToDevNull	There is a piece of hardware that needs a driver 
2018-08-12 01:20:14	@PipeItToDevNull	That has the most drivers 
2018-08-12 01:20:15	jackdog	like windows cant detect the usb
2018-08-12 01:20:16	Cypher-Punk	Did you verify the integrity of the iso that you've been using?
2018-08-12 01:20:20	@PipeItToDevNull	Nic, chipset, USB, etc 
2018-08-12 01:20:24	@PipeItToDevNull	No
2018-08-12 01:20:25	jackdog	wdym cypher punk
2018-08-12 01:20:38	jackdog	yeah i checked everything in the file
2018-08-12 01:20:46	jackdog	its everything the iso file needs
2018-08-12 01:21:07	Cypher-Punk	Like if you download an iso, sometimes you'll get a sha256 comparison file to see if it's an exactly copy
2018-08-12 01:21:11	Cypher-Punk	or if it got any corruption
2018-08-12 01:21:18	jackdog	its definitely not corrupt
2018-08-12 01:21:23	jackdog	i had to redownload 3 times already
2018-08-12 01:21:29	jackdog	if its the usb
2018-08-12 01:21:32	jackdog	ive tried 3 difffernt usbs
2018-08-12 01:21:59	Cypher-Punk	how did you install it to those flash drives? do you have an iso file that you use?
2018-08-12 01:22:13	jackdog	ok this is how i installed it
2018-08-12 01:22:21	jackdog	i went to some local shop bought a usb
2018-08-12 01:22:35	jackdog	the usb brand is transcend if you were wondering
2018-08-12 01:22:38	jackdog	its a 2.0
2018-08-12 01:22:40	jackdog	when i got home
2018-08-12 01:22:47	jackdog	i went on my laptop (currently using it rn)
2018-08-12 01:22:54	jackdog	downloaded the iso file from the website
2018-08-12 01:23:02	jackdog	installed it
2018-08-12 01:23:05	jackdog	plugged it in my new pc
2018-08-12 01:23:11	jackdog	everything went well
2018-08-12 01:23:14	jackdog	clicked install now
2018-08-12 01:23:17	jackdog	and then am
2018-08-12 01:23:19	jackdog	*bam
2018-08-12 01:23:23	jackdog	problem started
2018-08-12 01:23:54	@PipeItToDevNull	you downloaded an ISO file? From the site?
2018-08-12 01:23:56	Cypher-Punk	that original iso file from the website being potentially corrupt is what I was wondering about. like perhaps the download had a small error or something. so you redownloaded the actual file 3 times?
2018-08-12 01:24:00	jackdog	from microsoft
2018-08-12 01:24:07	@PipeItToDevNull	Either you are interchanging words or you did something wrong 
2018-08-12 01:24:35	jackdog	what
2018-08-12 01:24:39	Cypher-Punk	like for linux in my experience i download the iso file, then use a program that puts that iso file onto a flash drive for me (you likely used a program like that as well)
2018-08-12 01:25:00	jackdog	yeah i used mediacreation tool
2018-08-12 01:25:12	Cypher-Punk	i suggest redownloading the original iso file, then doing all the other steps the same
2018-08-12 01:25:16	jackdog	it wasnt from some 3rd party webste
2018-08-12 01:25:23	jackdog	i redownloaded it already 3 times tho ):
2018-08-12 01:25:26	@PipeItToDevNull	the tool wont give you an ISO 
2018-08-12 01:25:31	Cypher-Punk	oh okay you did download it
2018-08-12 01:25:31	@PipeItToDevNull	You will never see an ISO file 
2018-08-12 01:25:43	Cypher-Punk	that kills my idea then
2018-08-12 01:26:08	jackdog	windows just cant detect my usb for some reason
2018-08-12 01:26:15	jackdog	even tho windows cant appear without this usb lol
2018-08-12 01:26:18	Cypher-Punk	wait what?
2018-08-12 01:26:19	jackdog	idk if windows just being a douche to me
2018-08-12 01:26:28	Cypher-Punk	I don't think it works like that.
2018-08-12 01:26:32	jackdog	wait let me type everything the error is saying
2018-08-12 01:26:33	jackdog	one sec
2018-08-12 01:26:50	Cypher-Punk	If you're booting from it, i'm pretty sure windows is detecting the flash drive just fine, no offense.
2018-08-12 01:26:56	@PipeItToDevNull	It does 
2018-08-12 01:27:03	@PipeItToDevNull	It is missing a driver 
2018-08-12 01:27:18	jackdog	A media driver your computer needs is missing. This could be a dvd usb or hard disk driver if you have a cd dvd or usb please insert it now
2018-08-12 01:27:24	jackdog	thats what it say
2018-08-12 01:27:28	jackdog	wtf
2018-08-12 01:27:41	Cypher-Punk	Oh, weird.
2018-08-12 01:27:49	@PipeItToDevNull	yes, it wants a USB with the driver on ti 
2018-08-12 01:27:56	@PipeItToDevNull	Or a rolled ISO with the driver inside 
2018-08-12 01:28:00	jackdog	the usb is in tho
2018-08-12 01:28:10	jackdog	plus the installation wont even show without the usb
2018-08-12 01:28:16	Cypher-Punk	doesn't mean windows has the proper driver included though
2018-08-12 01:28:36	jackdog	so what could be the problem
2018-08-12 01:28:36	Cypher-Punk	as PipeItToDevNull said earlier
2018-08-12 01:28:55	jackdog	so i need to install something?
2018-08-12 01:28:59	@PipeItToDevNull	Jesus 
2018-08-12 01:28:59	@PipeItToDevNull	It is not on the USB 
2018-08-12 01:28:59	@PipeItToDevNull	It wants more drivers

2018-08-12 01:29:03	@PipeItToDevNull	That are not in the default install 
2018-08-12 01:29:09	Cypher-Punk	Sounds to me like your computer needs a driver that isn't included with your Windows 10 installation package.
2018-08-12 01:29:11	jackdog	so i need to switch the usb port
2018-08-12 01:29:16	@PipeItToDevNull	Jesus 
2018-08-12 01:29:17	@PipeItToDevNull	No 
2018-08-12 01:29:21	Cypher-Punk	oh, Pipe beat me to it
2018-08-12 01:29:49	jackdog	alright this is from my understanding

2018-08-12 01:30:01	jackdog	so somethings in my flash drive that windows doesn't want?
2018-08-12 01:30:08	Cypher-Punk	No.
2018-08-12 01:30:15	jackdog	oh
2018-08-12 01:30:22	@PipeItToDevNull	It wants MORE 
2018-08-12 01:30:32	jackdog	this is everything the iso gave
2018-08-12 01:30:34	jackdog	damn windows
2018-08-12 01:30:41	Cypher-Punk	Some piece of hardware in your computer needs a driver that isn't included with your Windows installation package.
2018-08-12 01:30:42	@PipeItToDevNull	hardware, not windows 
2018-08-12 01:30:46	jackdog	oh
2018-08-12 01:30:48	jackdog	everythings in
2018-08-12 01:30:49	jackdog	hdd
2018-08-12 01:30:50	jackdog	ram
2018-08-12 01:30:51	jackdog	mobo
2018-08-12 01:30:52	jackdog	cpu
2018-08-12 01:30:53	@PipeItToDevNull	Jesus 
2018-08-12 01:30:57	@PipeItToDevNull	yes, those needs drivers 
2018-08-12 01:31:02	jackdog	sorry if im acting like some 90 year old grandpa
2018-08-12 01:31:05	@PipeItToDevNull	Some of those drivers, are not in your ISO 
2018-08-12 01:31:11	Cypher-Punk	Did you understand my explanation though?
2018-08-12 01:31:14	jackdog	yeah
2018-08-12 01:31:19	Cypher-Punk	Okay, cool.
2018-08-12 01:31:21	jackdog	some drivers arent in the iso thats why
2018-08-12 01:31:28	jackdog	that correct?
2018-08-12 01:31:29	Cypher-Punk	yeah
2018-08-12 01:31:31	@PipeItToDevNull	I would start with Gigabyte, contact them 
2018-08-12 01:31:41	@PipeItToDevNull	I only experience this on Linux and it is easy AF to fix 
2018-08-12 01:31:42	jackdog	sorry havent slept for like 17 hours
2018-08-12 01:31:48	Cypher-Punk	it may be drivers that windows 10 doesn't come with normally
2018-08-12 01:31:59	jackdog	shouldve just installed windows 7 damn this is confusing
2018-08-12 01:32:08	Cypher-Punk	you might've had the same problem
2018-08-12 01:32:15	jackdog	godd
2018-08-12 01:32:38	Cypher-Punk	one problem is not knowing which piece of hardware needs the driver lol unfortuantely.
2018-08-12 01:32:49	jackdog	select the driver to install
2018-08-12 01:32:54	jackdog	and its asking me to pick inside the file
2018-08-12 01:32:54	jackdog	lol
2018-08-12 01:33:00	jackdog	alright let me contact gigabyte
2018-08-12 01:33:04	jackdog	what do i say to them
2018-08-12 01:33:06	jackdog	drivers missing?
2018-08-12 01:33:07	Cypher-Punk	yeah, it's hoping you have the driver file it needs somewhere and wants you to point it out
2018-08-12 01:33:09	@PipeItToDevNull	7 doesnt have a chance in hell of working 
2018-08-12 01:33:25	jackdog	damn windows xp sounds like heaven right now
2018-08-12 01:33:32	jackdog	wait
2018-08-12 01:33:36	jackdog	what if the driver is inside the usb
2018-08-12 01:33:39	jackdog	i just need to find it
2018-08-12 01:33:43	jackdog	or windows doesnt work like that
2018-08-12 01:33:46	@PipeItToDevNull	no
2018-08-12 01:33:49	Cypher-Punk	Unlikely, but I don't know.
2018-08-12 01:34:02	jackdog	i could ask microsoft tech support but they're closed lol

2018-08-12 01:38:25	Cypher-Punk	jackdog: yeah, i'd take PipeItToDevNull's advice and call the company or companies about that. I don't know how to really help with that one to be honest.
2018-08-12 01:38:37	@PipeItToDevNull	Yeah, I just know what the error is, but have never encountered it 
2018-08-12 01:38:41	jackdog	do you think microsoft support could do this
2018-08-12 01:38:44	jackdog	is this some rare issue

2018-08-12 01:40:25	Cypher-Punk	Lol
2018-08-12 01:41:03	Cypher-Punk	Yeah one part I keep thinking back to is "how the heck do you figure out which driver(s) you need that windows 10 doesn't have in the package?"
2018-08-12 01:41:04	jackdog	thanks for the help guys
2018-08-12 01:41:14	@PipeItToDevNull	Linux tells you 
2018-08-12 01:41:18	@PipeItToDevNull	And even gives you packages 
2018-08-12 01:41:23	jackdog	i cold go linux
2018-08-12 01:41:33	jackdog	but that operating system barely has games that supports it
2018-08-12 01:42:11	Cypher-Punk	There's WinE, which I've heard can play lots of windows games
2018-08-12 01:42:25	jackdog	WinE?
2018-08-12 01:42:40	jackdog	oh that wine bottler?
2018-08-12 01:42:44	jackdog	tried that on my mac os
2018-08-12 01:42:47	Cypher-Punk	wine, i think it stands for Windows Emulator. but idk, emulating sounds like it would use up a lot more resources than you'd use on native windows
2018-08-12 01:42:50	jackdog	oh
2018-08-12 01:43:17	jackdog	so yeah im just gonna go contact windows
2018-08-12 01:43:30	jackdog	if they cant solve this im goinna switch to 8.1 and see if that works
2018-08-12 01:43:34	Cypher-Punk	I get the best of both works. i have two drives in my laptop. Linux Mint for my main and Windows 10 for games and stuff
2018-08-12 01:43:40	Cypher-Punk	both worlds*

2018-08-12 09:24:00	SaltyGamer	I downloaded windows 10 but have not yet activated it
2018-08-12 09:24:09	SaltyGamer	there's a flash drive with windows 10 on it coming in a few days
2018-08-12 09:24:15	SaltyGamer	do I have to reinstall windows then?
2018-08-12 09:27:35	@Mikeee	activation is done through the internet or phone
2018-08-12 09:27:43	@Mikeee	you are very confused as to what activation is
2018-08-12 09:28:01	SaltyGamer	Oh... maybe I am
2018-08-12 09:28:19	SaltyGamer	I know you're supposed to enter a key or something
2018-08-12 09:28:31	SaltyGamer	but I've never used a bootable USB to install before
2018-08-12 09:28:47	SaltyGamer	except for the ones I created myself, but those are only the OS, not activated
2018-08-12 09:29:26	SaltyGamer	but the USB I ordered, it has a Retail version of Windows 10 Home, is that not activated by itself when I install it? Will there be a key in the box or a link or something then?
2018-08-12 09:30:06	@Mikeee	Installation media just contains installation files. It will install windows.
2018-08-12 09:30:17	SaltyGamer	Not activate it?
2018-08-12 09:30:18	@Mikeee	The part that costs money is the key itself
2018-08-12 09:30:22	SaltyGamer	I know

2018-08-12 09:30:54	SaltyGamer	I did, but the site is very much legit
2018-08-12 09:31:02	@Mikeee	you got scammed.
2018-08-12 09:31:03	SaltyGamer	so it will probably contain the key then...? I hope...

2018-08-12 09:41:31	Tris10	Okay thanks, what kind of hardware would i be looking at
2018-08-12 09:42:44	@Mikeee	You'll want access points. Routers that contain access points are not likely going to have the specs to do it
2018-08-12 09:43:26	@Mikeee	google "seamless handoff access points" to learn more.
2018-08-12 09:44:29	Tris10	Okay sounds good, I appreciate the help.

2018-08-12 15:51:52	@Mikeee	two possibilities, the more likely one is that your ISO is corrupt and you'll have to redownload it
2018-08-12 15:51:52	babymirky	like that
2018-08-12 15:52:01	babymirky	i redownloaded it 3 times already
2018-08-12 15:52:04	babymirky	same thing
2018-08-12 15:52:09	@Mikeee	did you do a HASH on the iso?
2018-08-12 15:52:13	babymirky	no
2018-08-12 15:52:13	@Mikeee	md5 is good
2018-08-12 15:52:16	@Mikeee	do it now
2018-08-12 15:52:24	babymirky	whats that anyways
2018-08-12 15:52:26	@Mikeee	google "md5 hash tool"
2018-08-12 15:52:30	babymirky	do i need to reinstall?

2018-08-12 15:57:27	Mikrob	Hey! I sat and used Chrome, when I heard a quiet beeping sound from my laptop. Soon after, it wouldn't respond and I had to force shut it. After a few tries to restart, it finally took me to the windows logo and said "preparing automatic repair". That finished, now it's all black. Would this be a MB issue?
2018-08-12 15:57:27	killersam19	and i installed the newest so it must work now
2018-08-12 15:57:37	@Mikeee	no idea. could be an error with the file, bad download, who knows

2018-08-12 17:43:03	Voop	i think a bug crawled in my psu and shorted it
2018-08-12 17:43:16	Voop	sparks shot out of the psu and now it doesnt turn on
2018-08-12 17:43:35	Voop	is my issue most likely ONLY dead psu, or do i likely have more damage
2018-08-12 17:43:49	Voop	should i just buy a psu or take it to the computer guy
2018-08-12 17:43:50	@Swede	it's likely only psu. Very bad luck otherwise
2018-08-12 17:44:10	@Swede	just get a psu. Not a shit brand, PSU's vary enormously in quality
2018-08-12 17:44:37	@Swede	it's easy to change
2018-08-12 17:44:54	@Swede	.. if you ever built a pc
2018-08-12 17:45:07	@Mikeee	or can watch a 5 minute youtube video
2018-08-12 17:45:12	@Swede	indeed
2018-08-12 17:45:17	Voop	well i was confused as to whether the ports for the cables on the psu were universal
2018-08-12 17:45:26	Voop	but i was told elsewhere that they are not
2018-08-12 17:45:37	Voop	so id need to rerun the cabling right
2018-08-12 17:45:38	@Swede	they are, except the modular plugs that go in the psu end
2018-08-12 17:45:41	@Swede	those are not standard
2018-08-12 17:45:59	@Swede	Unless you buy a very similar psu
2018-08-12 17:46:01	Voop	yeah, so i couldnt just pull all the plugs from the psu and connect it to a new one
2018-08-12 17:46:08	Voop	unless its the same psu
2018-08-12 17:46:24	@Swede	if it's modular and a very similar model, you could reuse cables
2018-08-12 17:46:39	@Swede	same brand+series
2018-08-12 17:46:54	@Swede	But you do get new cables, so why
2018-08-12 17:46:58	Voop	the one in there is/was a evga supernova 750g

2018-08-12 17:50:40	@Swede	typically visibly blown

2018-08-12 18:29:22	@Mikeee	It does not affect your ranking in /r/new in any way. Do not concern yourself with downvotes.
2018-08-12 18:29:35	gddmtt	I overwrote a previously saved file in LibreWriter yesterday. Used PhotoRec to recover, can't make sense of the results or how to find my lost file. Backup was not enabled.
2018-08-12 18:30:02	moreissues	thank mikeee
2018-08-12 18:30:36	@Mikeee	gddmtt:  what have you gone with for backups since?
2018-08-12 18:31:18	@Mikeee	and is librewriter still open to that file
2018-08-12 18:31:39	gddmtt	No, I closed it.
2018-08-12 18:32:09	@Mikeee	then your file is likely gone forever.
2018-08-12 18:32:52	@Mikeee	most word processing programs are designed to save in real time hundreds of copies of files, to prevent issues like this from happening
2018-08-12 18:33:10	@Mikeee	libreoffice does but you have to enable it first
2018-08-12 18:33:21	gddmtt	@Mikeee I enabled backup on Libre, but that won't help me now. I tried 'undo' and searching for previous versions
2018-08-12 18:33:41	@Mikeee	Have you gone through windows option of "previous versions"
2018-08-12 18:34:39	@Mikeee	What software do you use for your system's backup
2018-08-12 18:34:44	gddmtt	Libre had recovered the same file for me a previous time because PC shut down without saving, but I'm not sure if that is also overwritten.
2018-08-12 18:34:59	gddmtt	And yes, tried previous versions, there was nothing.
2018-08-12 18:35:09	gddmtt	TestDisk & PhotoRec
2018-08-12 18:35:09	PotatoMan	Bought a GPU on eBay. Seems to be faulty, but it's doing the same stuff my previous GPU did when I thought it had died. Before returning it, I want to make sure it's the actual GPU and not a different part of my computer that is faulty. Any ideas on how I can smartly go about confirming this?
2018-08-12 18:35:34	@Mikeee	Plug it into another system
2018-08-12 18:36:07	@Mikeee	gddmtt:  What software do you use for your system's backup
2018-08-12 18:36:23	gddmtt	I have numerous files unearthed by PhotoRec, have no idea if the save I'm looking for is .odf, or a temp file, XML, what I'm even looking for.
2018-08-12 18:36:31	@Mikeee	gddmtt:  What software do you use for your system's backup
2018-08-12 18:36:46	gddmtt	None?
2018-08-12 18:37:55	@Mikeee	Well I certainly hope you've learned from this and will set up a backup utility tonight to prevent this from ever happening again
2018-08-12 18:37:57	PotatoMan	I currently don't have another system available to use for testing. I was thinking about taking it to a repair shop, but I don't need it repaired, I just need to confirm if it works or not. So I'm kind of lost.
2018-08-12 18:38:18	@Mikeee	good thing it's just one file. When I had to learn that lesson, I lost hundreds of personal files and pictures
2018-08-12 18:38:44	gddmtt	It's a thesis paper
2018-08-12 18:38:53	@Mikeee	it's not a thesis paper
2018-08-12 18:39:08	@Mikeee	noone in their right mind would ever write a thesis paper on a single computer with no backup
2018-08-12 18:39:39	gddmtt	Welp
2018-08-12 18:39:44	@Mikeee	Try the libreoffice forums to find the file type you need to recover and maybe you can find a significantly older version of it
2018-08-12 18:40:09	@Mikeee	I would suggest not using the computer at all until you've made the attempts at recovery
2018-08-12 18:40:28	@Mikeee	as in, unplug it now and don't touch it until you either have the file or have completely given up on recovering it
2018-08-12 18:40:48	@Mikeee	every second it is on reduces the chances of any deleted files recovering.
2018-08-12 18:42:07	gddmtt	thanks, would suggest a bit of tact when helping the next person

2018-08-12 23:47:31	Potney	So
2018-08-12 23:48:06	Potney	I have a 16% bottleneck on my computer and I was wondering how much that could effect my performance
2018-08-12 23:48:07	UncleMusclesHour	whats up
2018-08-12 23:48:25	UncleMusclesHour	what are your specs?
2018-08-12 23:48:30	UncleMusclesHour	hardware specs
2018-08-12 23:48:34	@Swede	bottlenecks have numbers?`
2018-08-12 23:48:44	@PipeItToDevNull	wat
2018-08-12 23:48:55	UncleMusclesHour	and what is telling u that u have bottleneck
2018-08-12 23:49:20	@PipeItToDevNull	EVERY machine has a bottleneck 
2018-08-12 23:49:24	@PipeItToDevNull	it is the definition

2018-08-12 23:50:36	markasoftware	PipeItToDevNull: so, let's talk about game loading times
2018-08-12 23:50:46	UncleMusclesHour	you shouldn't be feeling any negative performance
2018-08-12 23:50:46	markasoftware	with a ramdisk, what's the bottleneck? It still takes upwards of 20 seconds to load a level in large games
2018-08-12 23:50:47	@PipeItToDevNull	wat 
2018-08-12 23:51:01	markasoftware	cpu typically isn1't stressed that much
2018-08-12 23:51:16	Potney	Alright well then it's not a bottleneck causing my problems then
2018-08-12 23:51:19	UncleMusclesHour	markasoftware: do you have an ssd?
2018-08-12 23:51:26	Potney	i can barely run CSGO

2018-08-12 23:52:07	@PipeItToDevNull	markasoftware, I dont know, shit takes time =P
2018-08-12 23:52:12	Potney	Loading into the game
2018-08-12 23:52:13	Potney	and then

2018-08-12 23:53:32	Potney	I do have things plugged in
2018-08-12 23:53:44	Potney	and its set in the right place
2018-08-12 23:53:47	UncleMusclesHour	like your monitor. is it plugged into your gpu
2018-08-12 23:53:51	Potney	Yes
2018-08-12 23:54:01	UncleMusclesHour	and not your mobo
2018-08-12 23:54:03	UncleMusclesHour	correct?
2018-08-12 23:54:14	Potney	Its in my GPU
2018-08-12 23:54:25	UncleMusclesHour	have you tried to lower your settings on overwatch and cs:go
2018-08-12 23:54:25	Potney	I used to have one in my GPU and one in my MOBO
2018-08-12 23:54:32	UncleMusclesHour	NO
2018-08-12 23:54:33	UncleMusclesHour	no
2018-08-12 23:54:39	Potney	Overwatch it helps
2018-08-12 23:54:39	UncleMusclesHour	only your GPU
2018-08-12 23:54:42	Potney	CSGO it doesnt
2018-08-12 23:54:50	UncleMusclesHour	put all cables to your GPU
2018-08-12 23:54:51	Potney	See I thought that was the problem
2018-08-12 23:55:00	Potney	So I undid it
2018-08-12 23:55:03	UncleMusclesHour	restart your computer
2018-08-12 23:55:07	UncleMusclesHour	after you did that
2018-08-12 23:55:11	Potney	Well
2018-08-12 23:55:16	Potney	To get it to work in the first place
2018-08-12 23:55:23	Potney	I had to get stuff setup in BIOS
2018-08-12 23:55:28	UncleMusclesHour	........
2018-08-12 23:55:35	UncleMusclesHour	that's so bad
2018-08-12 23:55:38	UncleMusclesHour	lol
2018-08-12 23:55:44	Potney	But I reset my BIOS to default
2018-08-12 23:55:48	UncleMusclesHour	ok good
2018-08-12 23:55:54	UncleMusclesHour	and all cables are on the gpu right?
2018-08-12 23:55:54	Potney	and the problem still occured
2018-08-12 23:55:57	Potney	yes
2018-08-12 23:56:15	UncleMusclesHour	ok are the games set on low
2018-08-12 23:56:18	UncleMusclesHour	graphics settings
2018-08-12 23:56:36	Potney	In CSGO Ive switched back and forth and nothing changed
2018-08-12 23:56:47	Potney	Overwatch was playable when I did
2018-08-12 23:57:03	Potney	and games like League of Legends lag big time in team fights
2018-08-12 23:57:17	Potney	Which all use to run perfectly fine on my old 750 TI
2018-08-12 23:57:34	UncleMusclesHour	oh reallyyyyyy

So suddenly, for no apparent reason, anytime I launch a game (anything from a high intensity game like Black Ops 4 Beta to a low resource game like MTG Arena, my cpu usage immediately spikes to 100% and make it unplayable. I have not had any issues with this in the past, and it just suddenly became an issue earlier today. As an addition
2018-08-13 00:29:40	Bearded	al note, this is probably unrelated but worth mentioning. I also am having an issue with my internet connection where my download speed has tanked from 100mbps to 3mbps. For the latter I'm contacting my ISP tomorrow but the former is pretty weird so any help is appreciated.

2018-08-13 00:36:56	Bearded	no, direct ethernet connection. but the networking issue is not my primary issue. the cpu problem is what I am a loss for :/
2018-08-13 00:38:08	Bearded	the only things that I can think of that in any way could be related is that I installed the Black Ops 4 beta, and I updated my GPU drivers. I doubt the first issue would be related but I guess I could reinstall my gpu drivers fresh to ensure something didnt go wrong with that I usppose
2018-08-13 00:39:59	Bearded	well I was but now my radeon settings are saying I dont even have a gpu driver installed :| I think my pc is just dying at this point :|

2018-08-13 13:03:04	Sea-Bot	CoJaBo  Thanks, Is there a way to change that, and would that be a setting on TV or laptop?  The tv is 720p. My 50" 1080 has no problem recognizing it.
2018-08-13 13:03:47	CoJaBo	Sea-Bot: Try changing the resolution on the laptop, probably to 720p or less

2018-08-13 13:08:10	Sea-Bot	CoJaBo Tried changing to all screen resolutions, didnt make a difference. Am I changing wrong setting? I just right clicked on desktop and went to display settings. Is there a way to change output settings instead?
2018-08-13 13:09:13	CoJaBo	Make sure it's changing it for the TV, not just the internal screen..
2018-08-13 13:10:27	CoJaBo	Wouldn't hurt to also try a different cable if you haven't already. Bad cables can cause bizarre problems like that. Is there any message displayed at all, or just a black screen and/or the display not showing up on the laptop?

2018-08-13 13:12:33	Sea-Bot	I think its just changing the laptop screen itself. It isnt recognizing that it is plugged in. Could try new cable, but this cable works for other laptop and PS3. No message displayed at all. I hit Function+F8 to project, and nothing changes on the TV.
2018-08-13 13:17:04	CoJaBo	Sea-Bot: It's possible for a bad cable to cause that problem; if it's not the cable, it might just be incompatible, that happens sometimes and unless there's a firmware update for the TV it may not be trivial to fix
2018-08-13 13:17:41	Sea-Bot	thanks. think i already tried another cable, but ill double check. cheers
2018-08-13 13:18:31	CoJaBo	Sea-Bot: If you have a box in the middle (audio splitter, stipper, etc) that might incidentally fix the problem, but that may not be a cheap fix, and may not even work at all

2018-08-13 13:33:12	karmakool	Hard drive in question was in a backpack and must have experienced some sort of shock or abrupt force. No water damage.
2018-08-13 13:33:12	karmakool	I've included a video of the Hard drive and the disk spins when plugged in and head starts to move towards the disk but moves back to the default position a couple times before the disk stops spinning. Also makes a beeping sound.
2018-08-13 13:33:12	karmakool	The data on it isn't very important but I would like to be able to use the hard drive again. Any help is greatly appreciated.

2018-08-13 13:36:12	CoJaBo	It's hard for that to happen without bending the arms or heads, which will likely result in catastrophic damage if the heads do manage to load, so that may not be fixable without a head/platter swap

2018-08-13 19:30:48	Naddox	CNetworkGeek same thing for that DISM, no component store corruption detected. completed successfully.
2018-08-13 19:31:02	CNetworkGeek	Can prob rule out system corruption then
2018-08-13 19:31:10	CNetworkGeek	At least for now
2018-08-13 19:31:29	Naddox	Lol, I removed the secondary drive when I did the new install
2018-08-13 19:31:43	Naddox	So shouldn't be anything
2018-08-13 19:31:54	Abraham	I've tried connecting the TV with an hdmi and the uhh red,yellow,white cables(not sure the name). The screen lights up but it doesn't get any input from whatever is being hooked up
2018-08-13 19:32:15	@PipeItToDevNull	How old is this thing to have N64 cables 
2018-08-13 19:32:39	@PipeItToDevNull	(I dont know what the fuck they are either)
2018-08-13 19:33:24	Naddox	RCA
2018-08-13 19:33:39	CNetworkGeek	@Naddox you'll to dive into the event logs to see if windows has any logs on what is happening.  I'd check under summary, error, warning, and lastly info.  Look for errors related to system processes or other applications.
2018-08-13 19:33:44	CNetworkGeek	you'll need*
2018-08-13 19:34:16	Naddox	sweet, my favorite thing to do
2018-08-13 19:34:29	CNetworkGeek	lol yeah, not the most fun thing for sure
2018-08-13 19:34:33	Abraham	haha, i dont think its super old. Maybe 10 years or so but it's a nice one and I'd hate to get rid of it without at least trying to figure out the problem! The sound works fine, I hooked it up to my Switch through HDMI
2018-08-13 19:34:44	@PipeItToDevNull	that is super old 
2018-08-13 19:34:53	Abraham	for real?? i thought tv's lasted ages x.x
2018-08-13 19:34:57	@PipeItToDevNull	When did it last work 
2018-08-13 19:35:02	CNetworkGeek	10 years?  Wow that's old for a TV
2018-08-13 19:35:24	Abraham	oh heck im a real idiot huh... it last worked maybe 5 years ago lmao
2018-08-13 19:35:34	@PipeItToDevNull	Where has it been?
2018-08-13 19:36:01	Abraham	just in my house, it stopped working when it was still being used daily but it hasn't been turned on till today in about a year
2018-08-13 19:36:14	Abraham	hasnt been through any terrible weather conditions
2018-08-13 19:37:20	@PipeItToDevNull	So it stopped working at some point in time, and just sat 
2018-08-13 19:37:34	@PipeItToDevNull	There are lots of things that could be wrong with that, not that I really know of 
2018-08-13 19:37:34	Abraham	correct haha, and boy did it sit
2018-08-13 19:38:00	CNetworkGeek	@Naddox, what kind of programs you have installed?
2018-08-13 19:38:05	CNetworkGeek	Besides games
2018-08-13 19:38:07	Abraham	true, the screen lights up when it's turned on though and when you lightly press it you can see it's "on" idk how else to describe it haha. but its just gray. and the sound works fine
2018-08-13 19:39:32	Naddox	Currently not much as we reinstalled windows ~3 weeks ago. Steam and some steam games and Office365
2018-08-13 19:39:54	CNetworkGeek	Running an anti-virus besides windows defender?
2018-08-13 19:40:08	Naddox	ESET
2018-08-13 19:40:45	CNetworkGeek	Lets rule out ESET
2018-08-13 19:41:00	CNetworkGeek	Disable it and only run Windows Defender for awhile
2018-08-13 19:41:06	CNetworkGeek	See if that makes a difference
2018-08-13 19:41:11	Naddox	I use it on my desktop and on our 2 laptops with no issues
2018-08-13 19:41:58	CNetworkGeek	Hmmmm, maybe not ESET then
2018-08-13 19:42:07	CNetworkGeek	I've seen it cause issues before for some people
2018-08-13 19:42:40	Naddox	Its what we install on all our machines at work, no issues so far lol

2018-08-13 20:49:31	snd	yeah, i mean I uninstalled both the generic audio driver as well as the Realtek one and restarted the laptop. When that didn't work, i manually downloaded them from Dell
2018-08-13 20:50:45	snd	when i click on the sound on the task bar, windows correctly displays (Realtek Audio)
2018-08-13 20:51:41	snd	there are also no other outputs that the sound could be going to

2018-08-13 20:54:08	Lynn25	And that it's enabled. I have actually stupidly made that mistake
2018-08-13 20:54:45	Lynn25	If all that doesn't work I'd run a diagnostic in the BIOS

2018-08-13 21:03:39	MrLuis	Not sure, bought it used and it worked fine and then it gave me a cancel sign on bootup. Driver utility couldn't fix it as it "could not write to last block"

2018-08-13 21:07:47	MrLuis	no, but its pretty easy to get one right
2018-08-13 21:07:53	snd	yep
2018-08-13 21:08:35	MrLuis	so what would i be doing with linux
2018-08-13 21:09:00	snd	reason being is that windows only formats to NTFS, FAT32 and FAT64, none of which can be used to install OSX onto
2018-08-13 21:09:10	MrLuis	right, i was worried about that
2018-08-13 21:09:30	MrLuis	okay. so you said any version works, is there one thats best to download?
2018-08-13 21:09:35	snd	OSX is a extremely modified version of Linux
2018-08-13 21:09:47	snd	so the file structure and format is the exact same
2018-08-13 21:10:46	MrLuis	ok. im at the download page, i guess ill get ubuntu its the only name i recognize
2018-08-13 21:10:53	snd	ok, that works
2018-08-13 21:10:54	@Swede	it's related via freeBSD, which is far off related to linux

2018-08-13 21:11:37	MrLuis	so ill have to create a partition on my windows PC to install ubuntu right
2018-08-13 21:11:43	MrLuis	oh yeah i can use a flashdrive
2018-08-13 21:11:50	snd	no, do you have a usb
2018-08-13 21:11:50	snd	yeah
2018-08-13 21:12:58	snd	i was simply thinking that installing linux on the hdd would cause it to format to ext2,3 or 4. Then, when you try to install OSX, it would be able to reformat and install on the exX
2018-08-13 21:12:58	MrLuis	ok so once i have it
2018-08-13 21:13:08	MrLuis	i see
2018-08-13 21:13:12	MrLuis	that makes sense

2018-08-13 22:21:56	FixItAgainTony	Clock speed is weird and lower than it should be. Should be 1333 or 667 says ot

2018-08-13 22:25:04	Lynn25	Wait so are you planning on replacing it?

2018-08-13 22:27:15	Lynn25	Ehh no probably not. Just wasn't sure since you talked about the ryzen and nitro

2018-08-13 22:29:48	lear	My question is this. I read some forums to stay safe about viruses, malware, phishing, etc. And they speak specifically that there may be the possibility of having malware in the advertisements. And I read in the Adblock Plus permissions and it says ''Access your data for all the websites '' Is it legitimate to use? Thanks for ur time,
2018-08-13 22:31:22	FixItAgainTony	in my opinion... yes, I have ABP myself
2018-08-13 22:31:37	@PipeItToDevNull	ABP is safe, but it is debated on ethics

2018-08-14 15:29:42	@Donjuanal	jbdman_, config looks fine, did it work on factory firmware?
2018-08-14 15:30:03	jbdman_	Yeah, additionally, I believe it was working a few weeks back on DD-WRT
2018-08-14 15:31:10	jbdman_	Recently, I've also been having issues with Spice QEMU KVM also. I can talk to my proxmox server, and the VM's within, but when I try to connect with Virt-Viewer, i get Socket I/O Timed Out.
2018-08-14 15:31:41	jbdman_	I'd love to go back to stock, but Netgear Butchered IPV6 on their firmware.
2018-08-14 15:32:05	@Donjuanal	sounds to me like your issue is on the server and not on the router
2018-08-14 15:36:07	jbdman_	But the thing is, I can access it directly from the router...
2018-08-14 15:42:50	@Donjuanal	jbdman_, that doesnt mean the issue isn't on the server
2018-08-14 15:43:04	@Donjuanal	especially if you're having problems with other server functionality
2018-08-14 15:43:09	@Donjuanal	do you have just a dumb switch?
2018-08-14 15:43:30	jbdman_	That is on a separate server. No, its a managed switch. This was the management ip that I've been trying to access the whole time
2018-08-14 15:43:35	@Donjuanal	or have you tried wired yet to see if the issue is still present?
2018-08-14 15:43:50	jbdman_	Let me find a device i can wire in. Please hold
2018-08-14 15:44:27	@Donjuanal	is it a dedicated management interface or an SVI on the switch?
2018-08-14 15:44:52	@Donjuanal	share the powerconnect config if you can as well
2018-08-14 15:46:26	jbdman_	Its a virtual interface
2018-08-14 15:46:41	jbdman_	I can't find a single device that would be easy to wire in...
